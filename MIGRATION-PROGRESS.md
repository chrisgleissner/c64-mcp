# C64-MCP Migration Progress

**Started:** 2025-10-25
**Current Step:** 5.2
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-25T23:45:00+01:00


## Process Guidelines

- **Purpose:**
  - Bring the MCP server in line with **MCP SDK** standards for consistency and reuse.  
  - Equip any LLM using this agent with deep **C64 expertise**, enabling it to create BASIC/Assembly programs, music, and graphics, and control the C64. It should retrieve context mainly from the `data` folder—prioritizing `*spec.md` files, then other `.md` files, and finally any remaining text sources.
- **At step start:** Review `doc/tasks/use-mcp-sdk.md`, source code, and configs to understand the task.  
- **At step completion:** Update this tracker and `doc/tasks/use-mcp-sdk.md`.
