Avoid ultra-unstable forms (`ANE`, `LXA`, `SHA`).\n- When sharing code, prefer documented opcodes unless cycle critical.","sourcePath":"doc/6502-instructions.md","sourceMtimeMs":1760978928061.961},{"name":"doc/context/bootstrap.md","language":"hardware","vector":[0,0,0,-0.04584696516394615,-0.011461741290986538,0,0,0.011461741290986538,0,0,-0.04584696516394615,0,0,0.011461741290986538,0,0,-0.011461741290986538,0,0.13754089176654816,0,0,-0.04584696516394615,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.022923482581973076,0,0,0.13754089176654816,0,0,0,0,0,0.022923482581973076,0,0,0,0,0.04584696516394615,0.022923482581973076,0,0,0,0,0,0.03438522294163704,0,-0.04584696516394615,-0.011461741290986538,0,0,0.03438522294163704,0,0,-0.022923482581973076,0,0,0.022923482581973076,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.022923482581973076,0,0.04584696516394615,0,0,0,-0.022923482581973076,0,0.04584696516394615,0.022923482581973076,0,0,0,0,0.04584696516394615,0.022923482581973076,0,-0.1833878606557846,0,0,0,0.022923482581973076,0,-0.04584696516394615,-0.057308707386255264,0,0,0,0,0,-0.022923482581973076,0,0.3667757213115692,0,0,0,-0.011461741290986538,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04584696516394615,0.06877044588327408,0,0,-0.022923482581973076,0,0.04584696516394615,0,0,0,-0.022923482581973076,0,0.13754089176654816,0,0,-0.22923482954502106,0,0,0.04584696516394615,0,0,-0.04584696516394615,0,0,0.04584696516394615,0.022923482581973076,0,0,-0.011461741290986538,0,0,0,0,0,-0.022923482581973076,0,0.2750817835330963,0.011461741290986538,0,-0.0916939303278923,0,0,0,0.011461741290986538,0,-0.04584696516394615,0,0,0,0.011461741290986538,0,0,0,0,0,0.03438522294163704,0,0,-0.011461741290986538,0,0,0.03438522294163704,0,-0.04584696516394615,0,0,0.04584696516394615,0.022923482581973076,0,0,-0.0916939303278923,0,0.04584696516394615,0,0,-0.04584696516394615,-0.022923482581973076,0,0,0.011461741290986538,0,0,0,0,0,0.19484961032867432,0,0,0,0,0.5501635670661926,0.011461741290986538,0,0,-0.022923482581973076,0,0,0.022923482581973076,0,0,-0.011461741290986538,0,0,0.022923482581973076,0,0,0,0,0.04584696516394615,0.06877044588327408,0,-0.04584696516394615,-0.11461741477251053,0,0.04584696516394615,0.057308707386255264,0,0,-0.03438522294163704,0,0,0.022923482581973076,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.0916939303278923,0,0,0,0.13754089176654816,0,-0.0916939303278923,-0.04584696516394615,0,0,0.011461741290986538,0,0,-0.022923482581973076,0,0,0,0,0,-0.011461741290986538,0,0,0,0,-0.04584696516394615,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.022923482581973076,0,0,0.022923482581973076,0,-0.04584696516394615,0,0,0,0.03438522294163704,0,0,-0.022923482581973076,0,0,0.011461741290986538,0,0,0,0,0,0.011461741290986538,0,-0.0916939303278923,-0.04584696516394615,0,0,0.2750817835330963,0,0,-0.011461741290986538,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0916939303278923,0,-0.04584696516394615,0,0,0,0.022923482581973076,0,0,-0.022923482581973076,0,0.04584696516394615,0.03438522294163704,0,0,0,0,0.04584696516394615,0.011461741290986538,0,0,0,0,0.04584696516394615,0.03438522294163704,0,0,-0.10315567255020142,0,0.04584696516394615,0.011461741290986538,0,-0.04584696516394615,-0.057308707386255264,0,0.04584696516394615,0.011461741290986538,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06877044588327408,0,0,-0.04584696516394615,0,0.04584696516394615,0,0,0,-0.011461741290986538,0,0.04584696516394615,0,0,0,-0.022923482581973076,0,0.04584696516394615,0,0,-0.0916939303278923,0,0],"text":"<!--

each tick (software LFO).  \n**PWM** – Periodic variation of pulse-width for animated tone.  \n**Filter Sweep** – Ramp cutoff ($D415/$D416) and/or resonance ($D417).  \n**Hard Restart** – Clear GATE early, optionally TEST=1 to reset osc; next tick set ADSR + GATE=1 for tight attack.  \n**Sync / Ring-Mod** – Enable SYNC or RING bits in CTRL to tie oscillators.  \n**Digi Playback** – Rapid writes
