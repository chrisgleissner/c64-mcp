goal is to help the user create expressive SID music on the Commodore 64.\n\n1. Ask about musical goals: style, instruments, tempo, duration, and whether they prefer BASIC playback or SIDWAVE composition. Reference the best-practice notes in [`sid-programming-best-practices.md`](../../data/audio/sid-programming-best-practices.md).\n2. Draft a composition plan with phrasing guidance. When gathering inspiration or technique snippets, use `c64.rag` (op `basic`/`asm`) targeting SID resources.\n3. Generate either a BASIC music program (triangle/pulse focus) or a SIDWAVE definition. Execute playback with `c64.program` (op `upload_run_basic`), `c64.sound` (op `generate`), or `c64.sound` (op `compile_play`) depending on the chosen format.\n4. Encourage verification by calling `c64.sound` (ops `record_analyze` or `analyze`), summarising detected notes and timing. Offer manual tweaks via `c64.sound` (ops `note_on`, `note_off`, `set_volume`) where appropriate.\n5. Provide exporting and archival options: saving PRGs/SIDs to disk (`c64.disk` op `create_image`, then `c64.disk` op `mount`) and noting how to restore the SID state (`c64.sound` ops `reset`,

Source: doc/improve-knowledge/notes.md#Additional Acceptance Criteria (New Tasks) -->\n## Additional Acceptance Criteria (New Tasks)\n\n- **License info in RAG (S2)**: Structured RAG outputs expose `spdxId` only (replaces license name/URL), along with `uri`, `origin`, `snippet`, and `score`.\n- **What changed summary (D1)**: README or resource index contains a concise, auto-updated summary of tool/resource changes with a link to platform status.\n- **Prompt cross-links (D2)**: Prompts referencing SID/graphics/PETSCII include `relatedResources` pointing to best-practices and quickrefs.\n- **BASIC pitfalls resource (K3)**: A brief, actionable quickref exists and is listed in the knowledge index; BASIC runners reference it.\n- **PETSCII/charset quickrefs (K4)**: PETSCII char codes and glyph mapping are published as resources; retrieval returns URIs to them.\n- **VIC-II quickref (K5)**: Register quickref is exposed as a resource and linked from graphics tools.\n- **Sprite & Charset workflows doc (K6)**: New doc published and exposed; graphics tools and prompts link to it.\n- **RAG URIs (R2)**: RAG results consistently include `c64://` resource URIs where applicable; `ReadResource` can open them.\n- **Retrieval diversity (R3)**: Top-K results have basic de-duplication and domain diversity; tests cover presence of varied domains.\n- **PETSCII presets docs (G5)**: Documented style presets exist; prompts mention how to select them.\n- **Hires bitmap PRG generator (G6)**: A tool exists to render a static bitmap; a minimal example and test verify it runs and captures a screen.\n- **Graphics tests (T4/T5)**: PETSCII generation and sprite preview PRG flows have e2e tests asserting key structured fields and behavior.\n- **Container workflow (S1)**: ✅ Dockerfile updated to use `ubuntu:24.04` with Node.js 20 (via `n` version manager) and Bun, create a non-root `c64bridge` user at `/app`, run `npm ci` during build, copy the repo, and set `CMD

Source: doc/improve-knowledge/plan.md#1) Executive Summary -->\n### 1) Executive Summary\n\nThe server exposes a rich, well-typed MCP surface with clear schemas, strong logging, a deterministic local RAG, and extensive tests. The biggest gaps affecting LLM effectiveness are:\n\n- (1) RAG results are returned as raw text rather than structured, referenceable snippets;\n- (2) key domain docs (memory/IO maps, SID best-practices) are not exposed as MCP resources;\n- (3) creative defaults (e.g., SID waveform/ADSR) aren’t aligned with the repo’s own musical best-practices.

Parse `<!-- Source: ... -->` and include score. | Text returned: `src/tools/rag.ts:82-128`; retriever: `src/rag/retriever.ts:37-80`; provenance comment injected: `src/rag/indexer.ts:769-772` | M | 5 | Requires minor client-side changes reading structured refs. |\n| R2 | Include bundle/resource URIs (e.g., `c64://specs/*`) in RAG results when matches originate from docs; enable quick “open resource.” | `src/rag/knowledgeIndex.ts:328-359` (index resource), doc chunking: `720-767` | S | 4 | Slight mapping logic; greatly improves provenance and navigation. |\n| R3 | Add diversity heuristic (basic+asm mixed fallback already exists) and simple duplicate suppression in top-K. | `src/rag/retriever.ts:70-76,78-80` | S | 3 | Keeps refs varied; minimal complexity. |\n| R4 | Add domain weighting to retrieval (boost SID/graphics docs when relevant). | `src/rag/retriever.ts` scoring path; tool domain is known at call sites | M | 4 | More relevant grounding for PETSCII/sprites/SID

Risks/Trade-offs |\n|----|----------------|-----------------------------|---------|-----------|------------------|\n| T1 | Add tests asserting `music_generate` new defaults (tri/ADSR) and pitch accuracy by PAL/NTSC. | Audio analysis tests exist: `test/audioAnalysis.test.mjs:56-141`; `hzToSidFrequency`: `src/c64Client.ts:773-778` | S | 4 | Keeps musical defaults from regressing. |\n| T2 | Add a small e2e test for `rag_retrieve_*` verifying structured refs and that URIs open via `ReadResource`. | `src/tools/rag.ts:82-128`, `src/mcp-server.ts:133-176` | M | 4 | Increases confidence in RAG interoperability. |\n| T3 | Quick test to ensure `read_screen` works without prior `upload_run_basic`. | `src/tools/memory.ts:81-99` | S | 3 | Guards against accidental pre-req regressions. |\n| T4 | Add e2e test for PETSCII generation: verify preview fields and PRG runs. | `src/tools/graphics.ts`, `test/graphicsModule.test.mjs` | S | 4 | Prevents regressions in graphics outputs crucial for PETSCII art. |\n| T5 | Add sprite preview PRG test: bytes copied, coords/colour applied, screen captured. | `src/tools/graphics.ts`, `test/graphicsModule.test.mjs` | S | 4 | Ensures sprite workflows

context for `sid_note_on`; reflect in metadata (`src/c64Client.ts`, `src/tools/audio.ts`).\n- [x] G3: Include PRG metadata (entry addresses, bytes) in program runners’ structured outputs (`src/tools/programRunners.ts`).\n- [x] G4: Ensure PETSCII structured outputs and docs highlight selected glyphs/codes and miniature preview (`src/tools/graphics.ts`, docs).\n- [x] G5: Document PETSCII style presets (contrast, dithering, palette) and link from prompts (`src/prompts/registry.ts`, docs under `data/video/`).\n- [ ] G6: Add hires bitmap PRG generator tool and document a minimal usage flow (`src/tools/graphics.ts`, `test/graphicsModule.test.mjs`).\n- [x] K6: Add “Sprite & Charset workflows best-practices” document and expose as resource (`data/video/sprite-charset-best-practices.md`, `src/rag/knowledgeIndex.ts`).\n- [x] T4: Add PETSCII generation e2e test verifying preview fields and PRG execution (`test/graphicsModule.test.mjs`).\n-

the REST surface:\n\n- Memory: `c64.memory` (operations: `read`, `write`, `read_screen`, `wait_for_text`)\n- Programs: `c64.program` (operations: `upload_run_basic`, `upload_run_asm`, `run_prg`, `load_prg`, `run_crt`, `batch_run`, `bundle_run`)\n- Machine control: `c64.system` (operations: `pause`, `resume`, `reset`, `reboot`, `poweroff`, `menu`, `start_task`, `stop_task`, `stop_all_tasks`, `list_tasks`)\n- Storage: `c64.disk` (operations: `list_drives`, `mount`, `unmount`, `file_info`, `create_image`, `find_and_run`) and `c64.drive` (operations: `reset`, `power_on`, `power_off`, `set_mode`, `load_rom`)\n- Audio/SID: `c64.sound` (ops `set_volume`, `reset`, `note_on`, `note_off`, `silence_all`, `play_sid_file`, `play_mod_file`, `generate`, `compile_play`, `pipeline`, `record_analyze`, `analyze`)\n- Streaming: `c64.stream` (ops `start`, `stop`)\n- Developer/Config: `c64.config` (ops `list`, `get`, `set`, `batch_update`, `load_flash`, `save_flash`, `reset_defaults`, `read_debugreg`, `write_debugreg`, `info`, `version`, `snapshot`, `restore`, `diff`, `shuffle`)\n\nBy bundling these into single, parameterized meta tools with agent-side scheduling and state, the

Source: external/github.com/kschuetz_c64-chip8/roms/games/Programmable Spacefighters [Jef Winsor].txt#Page-1 -->\n14. VIP Programmable Spacefighters\n\nProgrammable Spacefighters is a combat game involving 2 to 8 spaceships competing\nfor the domination of a contained field in space.  The field of play is a \ntwo-dimensional representation of an oblong spheroid.\n\nThe movement and fire of each spacefighter is controlled by programming a series of\ncommands into each fighter's instruction storage table.  Once all the spacefighters\nare programmed, they carry out their commands by sequentially executing a single step\nat a time.  The play of the game ins divided into rounds.  Each spacefighter may\nexecute between 1 and 15 commands per round.\n\nThe fighters all have the same appearance and capabilities.  Players distinguish\nbetween fighters by examining the defense strength and position of their fighters\nat the begining of every round.\n\nEach fighter may face in any of 8 directions.  All firing and forward movement\noccurs in the direction the fighter is currently facing.  As a spacefighter crosses\noutside the two-dimensional field of play, it wraps around and re-enters on the\nopposite side of the field.  Laser bursts terminate when they travel outside the\nfield or hit a target.\n\nEach round consists of a selected number of steps.  Each step is executed in 2 parts.\nDuring the first part, every spacefighter wishing to fire may execute a fire operation.\nThe defense strength of any fighter which is hit by a laser burst is reduced

Source: external/github.com/kschuetz_c64-chip8/roms/games/Programmable Spacefighters [Jef Winsor].txt#Page-1-2 -->\nAfter all fighters have had an opportunity to execute fire instructions, the movement\npart of the step begins.  Any fighter which has had its defense strength reduced to 0\nis destroyed and a longer flash appears.  The defense strength is changed to a special\ncode so that the fighter will no longer be programmable or take part in the execution\nphase.  The destroyed fighter will still be open to examination during the Defense/\nPosition Check phase.  Fighers having a defense strength greater than 0 may execute\na movement command if there is one.  Breaking each step into 2 such parts removes any\nstrategic advantage to moving first.\n\nThe nature of the game, in that there are variable parameters and no fixed victory\nconditions, allows the players a lot of freedom.  Two to eight players can command\nsingle fighters.  Four or less players can each command multiple fighters.  Two\nfleets could complete to destroy their opponents' flagship first.  Handicaps can\nbe implemented through an imbalance of fighters in different fleets.  An odd number\nof players can play in a free for all or team game.  In a non-combat approach, a full\ncomplement of space fighters could be programmed to preform in kaleidoscope or other\ntype formations.\n\nHow to Play VIP Programmable Spacefighters\n\n1. Load the CHIP-8 interpreter at 0000-01FF and\n   the game starting at 0200.\n\n2. Turn RUN switch on.\n\n3. Initalization of Game.\n   Various parameters are entered at the start of the game to determine the number\n   of spacefighters and other aspects of play.","sourcePath":"external/github.com/kschuetz_c64-chip8/roms/games/Programmable Spacefighters [Jef

However, a file name is not required to SAVE to device 1, the cassette.\n                                Any attempt to save to other devices without using a file name results in an error.\n                                NOTE: device 0, the keyboard, and device 3, the screen, cannot be SAVEd to.

55296 ($D800).  There are, however, two variations\n                          which alter this scheme somewhat.\n\nThe first is called multicolor text mode, and is set by Bit 4 of 53270\n                          ($D016).  Instead of each bit selecting either the foreground or the\n                          background color for each dot in the character, bit-pairs are used to\n                          select one of four colors for each double-width dot.  This results in\n                          the horizontal resolution being cut to four dots across per character,\n                          but allows two extra colors to be introduced from Background Color\n                          Registers 1 and 2 (53282-53283, $D022-$D023).\n\nThe other text mode is called Extended Background Color Mode.  In this\n                          mode, the foreground color is always selected by the Color RAM.  The\n                          background color depends on the actual screen code of the character.\n                          In this mode, only the first 64 character shapes are available, but\n                          each can have one of four different background colors.\n\nThe background color for each character is determined by its screen\n                          code as

and one of which can be selected individually.\n                          Multicolor bitmap mode offers a choice of four colors, three of which\n                          can be individually selected within an 8 by 8 dot area.\n\nThe 64 also contains an entirely separate graphics system, whose\n                          character shapes, colors, and positions are derived and displayed\n                          without any reference to the Video Matrix and Character Dot-Data\n                          addresses.  Best of all, these characters may be moved quickly and\n                          easily to any position on the screen, greatly facilitating games and\n                          animated graphics of all types.  This system is known as sprite\n                          graphics.\n\nSprite graphics takes its name from the graphics characters it\n                          displays, each of which is called a sprite.  There are eight sprites,\n                          known as Sprites 0-7.  Each sprite character is 24 dots wide by 21\n                          dots high.  This is about eight times as large as a regular text\n                          character, which is only 8 dots wide by 8 dots

flexibility.  Sprite expand registers allow you to make\n                          each sprite twice as wide as normal, twice as tall, or both.\n                          Collision detection registers let you know when a sprite shape\n                          overlaps a regular text character or bitmap dot, or if two sprites are\n                          touching.\n\nIf a sprite is positioned in the same place on the screen as a text\n                          character or bitmap dot, a Priority Register allows you to choose\n                          whether the sprite or the normal graphics will be displayed.  This\n                          enables three- dimensional effects by letting you choose whether the\n                          sprite goes in front of or behind other objects on the screen.\n\nFinally, any sprite may be selected for multicolor display, using the\n                          register at location 53276 ($D01C).  In this mode, as in multicolor\n                          text and bitmap modes, pairs of bits are used to determine the color\n                          of each double- width dot.  The possible color values which may be\n                          selected are those of Background Color Register 0, the Sprite Color\n                          Register, or the two color values in the Sprite Multicolor Registers\n                          at 53285-53286 ($D025-$D026).\n\n$D000-$D010               Sprite Horizontal and Vertical Position

This bit register allows you to select either the normal\n                          25-line text display (by setting the bit to 1), or a shortened 24-row\n                          display (by resetting that bit to 0).  This shortened display is\n                          created by extending the border to overlap the top or bottom row.  The\n                          characters in these rows are still there; they are just covered up.\n\nThe shortened display is designed to aid vertical fine scrolling.  It\n                          covers up the line into which new screen data is introduced, so that\n                          the viewer does not see the new data being moved into place.\n\nHowever, unlink the register at 53270 ($D016) which shortens the\n                          screen by one character space on either side to aid horizontal\n                          scrolling in either direction, this register can blank only one\n                          vertical line at a time.  In order to compensate, it blanks the top\n                          line when the three scroll bits in this register are set to 0, and\n                          shifts the blanking one scan line at a time as the value of thee bits\n                          increases.  Thus the bottom line is totally blanked when these bits\n                          are set to

Source: external/github.com/mist64_c64ref/src/c64io/c64io_mapc64.txt#Page-1-26 -->\nThe 64's bitmap graphics mode also resembles character graphics in\n                          that the foreground color of the dots is set by a color map (although\n                          it does not use the Color RAM for this purpose).  Four bits of each\n                          byte of this color memory control the foreground color of one of these\n                          eight-byte groups of display memory (which form an 8 by 8 grid of 64\n                          dots).  Unlike character graphics, however, the other four bits\n                          control the background color that will be seen in the eight-byte\n                          display group where a bit has a value of 0.\n\nSetting up a bitmap graphics screen is somewhat more complicated than\n                          just setting this register bit to 1.  You must first choose a location\n                          for the display memory area, and for the color memory area.  The\n                          display memory area will be 8192 bytes long (8000 of which are\n                          actually used for the display) and can occupy only the first or the\n                          second half of the 16K space which the VIC-II chip can

left-hand side of the screen, and dot 319 at the extreme\n                          right.  Vertical positions will range from 0 to 199, where dot 0 is on\n                          the top line, and dot 199 is on the bottom line.\n\nBecause of the unusual layout of bitmap screen data on the 64, it is\n                          fairly easy to transfer text characters to a bitmap screen, but it is\n                          somewhat awkward finding the bit which affects the screen dot having a\n                          given X-Y coordinate.  First, you must find the byte BY in which the\n                          bit resides, and then you must POKE a value into that byte which turns\n                          the desired bit on or off.  Given that the horizontal position of the\n                          dot is stored in the variable X, its vertical position is in the\n                          variable Y, and the base address of the bitmap area is in the variable\n                          BASE, you can find the desired byte with the

the screen.  The values in these registers are updated once every\n                          screen frame (60 times per second).  Once the switch is closed and a\n                          value written to these registers, the registers are latched, and\n                          subsequent switch closings during the same screen frame will not be\n                          recorded.\n\nA given light pen may not be entirely accurate (and the operator may\n                          not have a steady hand).  It is probably wise to average the positions\n                          returned from a number of samplings, particularly when using a machine\n                          language driver.\n\n$D013        LPENX        Light Pen Horizontal Position\n\nThis location holds the horizontal position of the light pen.  Since\n                          there are only eight bits available (which give a range of 256 values)\n                          for 320 possible horizontal screen positions, the value here is\n                          accurate only to every second dot position.  The number here will\n                          range from 0 to 160 and must be multiplied by 2 in order to get a\n                          close approximation of the actual horizontal dot position

the VIC-II chip.  On power-up, it is set to a default value of 8,\n                          which means that the VIC chip Reset line is set for a normal display,\n                          Multicolor Mode is disabled, a 40-column text display is selected, and\n                          no horizontal fine-scroll offset is used.\n\nBits 0-2.  The first three bits of this chip control vertical fine\n                          scrolling of the screen display.  This feature allows you to smoothly\n                          move the entire text display back and forth, enabling the display area\n                          to act as a window, scrolling over a larger text or character graphics\n                          display.\n\nSince each text character is eight dots wide, moving each character\n                          over one whole character position (known as coarse scrolling) is a\n                          relatively big jump, and the motion looks jerky.  By placing a number\n                          from 1 to 7 into these three bits, you can move the whole screen\n                          display from one to seven dot spaces to the right.\n\nStepping through values 1 to 7 allows you to smoothly make the\n                          transition from having a character appear at one screen column to\n                          having it appear at the next one over.  To demonstrate this, type in\n                          the following program, LIST, and RUN

The light sensor on the light pen has been struck by the raster\n                          beam, causing the fire button switch on joystick Control Port #1 to\n                          close (pressing the joystick fire button can have the same effect).\n\nWhen one of these conditions is met, the corresponding bit in this\n                          status register is set to 1 and latched.

For example, line 49273 holds the data that will go\n                          into Control Register 2.

The first number, 24, is placed into Control Register 2\n                          during the bottom part of the screen display, and changes that portion\n                          of the display to

                         a collision, they do not necessarily tell you what objects have\n                          collided with each other.  It is quite possible to have three sprites\n                          lined up in a row, where Sprite A is on the left, Sprite B is in the\n                          middle, touching Sprite A, and Sprite C is on the right, touching\n                          Sprite B but not touching Sprite A.  The Sprite-Sprite Collision\n                          register would show that all three are involved.  The only way to make\n                          absolutely certain which collided with which is to check the position\n                          of each sprite, and calculate for each sprite display line if a sprite\n                          of that size would touch either of the others.  As you can imagine,\n                          this is no easy task.\n\nThere are a few simple rules concerning what does or does not cause a\n                          collision.  Though the sprite character consists of 504 dots in a 24\n                          by 21 matrix, does which represent data bits that are equal to 0 (or\n                          multicolor bit- pairs equal to 00), and therefore always displayed in\n                          the background color, do not count when it comes to

                       oscillator gated, as we say).  This is done by writing certain bits to\n                          the Control Register.  The waveform control lets you select one of\n                          four different waveforms, each of which has varying harmonic content\n                          that affects the tone quality of the sound.  By writing a 1 to the\n                          gate bit, you start the Attack/ Delay/Sustain cycle.  After rising to a\n                          peak and declining to the Sustain volume, the volume will continue at\n                          the same level until you write a 0 to the gate bit.  Then, the Release\n                          cycle will start.  Make sure that you keep the same waveform bit set\n                          to 1 while you write the 0 to the gate bit, so that the Release cycle\n                          starts.  Otherwise, the sound will stop entirely, as it also will if\n                          the Volume Register or the Frequency Register is set to 0.\n\nIt should be noted that except for the last four SID chip registers,\n                          these addresses are write-only.  That means that their values cannot\n                          be determined by PEEKing these locations.\n\n$D400-$D401               Voice 1 Frequency Control","sourcePath":"external/github.com/mist64_c64ref/src/c64io/c64io_mapc64.txt","sourceMtimeMs":1741819955000,"sourceUrl":"https://github.com/mist64/c64ref/blob/main/c64io/c64io_mapc64.txt","sourceRepoUrl":"https://github.com/mist64/c64ref","license":"BSD-2-Clause","licenseSpdxId":"BSD-2-Clause","licenseName":"BSD 2-Clause \"Simplified\" License","licenseUrl":"https://github.com/mist64/c64ref/blob/main/LICENSE","attribution":"Source: mist64/c64ref (BSD-2-Clause)","origin":"external/github.com/mist64_c64ref/src/c64io/c64io_mapc64.txt#BINOT-X-AND-3POKE-BYPEEKBY-AND-NOT-3CABI-OR-COCABI-37"},{"name":"github.com/mist64_c64ref/src/c64io/c64io_mapc64.txt","language":"hardware","vector":[0,0.025154192000627518,0,0,-0.050308384001255035,0,0.03353892266750336,0.041923653334379196,0,0,-0.01676946133375168,0,0.03353892266750336,0.00838473066687584,0,0,-0.03353892266750336,0,0.06707784533500671,0.03353892266750336,0,0,-0.00838473066687584,0,0.03353892266750336,0.025154192000627518,0,0,0,0,0.03353892266750336,0.041923653334379196,0,0,-0.00838473066687584,0,0.03353892266750336,0.01676946133375168,0,-0.03353892266750336,0,0,0.06707784533500671,0.01676946133375168,0,0,-0.041923653334379196,0,0.03353892266750336,0.03353892266750336,0,0,0,0,0.13415569067001343,0.00838473066687584,0,-0.03353892266750336,-0.03353892266750336,0,0.03353892266750336,0.06707784533500671,0,-0.03353892266750336,-0.00838473066687584,0,0.06707784533500671,0,0,0,-0.00838473066687584,0,0,0,0,0,-0.025154192000627518,0,0,0.01676946133375168,0,-0.06707784533500671,0,0,0.03353892266750336,0.00838473066687584,0,-0.16769461333751678,-0.11738622933626175,0,0.06707784533500671,0.10900150239467621,0,-0.06707784533500671,-0.01676946133375168,0,0.03353892266750336,0,0,0,-0.03353892266750336,0,0.5030838251113892,0.025154192000627518,0,-0.03353892266750336,0,0,0.03353892266750336,0.01676946133375168,0,0,0,0,0.03353892266750336,0.041923653334379196,0,0,0,0,0.06707784533500671,0.03353892266750336,0,0,-0.00838473066687584,0,0.2347724586725235,0.01676946133375168,0,-0.06707784533500671,0,0,0,0.03353892266750336,0,0,-0.01676946133375168,0,0.03353892266750336,0.041923653334379196,0,0,0,0,0,0.01676946133375168,0,-0.06707784533500671,0,0,0.20123353600502014,0.07546257972717285,0,0,-0.01676946133375168,0,0,0.025154192000627518,0,-0.06707784533500671,-0.03353892266750336,0,0.03353892266750336,0.050308384001255035,0,0,0,0,0.03353892266750336,0,0,-0.06707784533500671,-0.01676946133375168,0,0.03353892266750336,0.03353892266750336,0,-0.20123353600502014,-0.03353892266750336,0,0.03353892266750336,0.01676946133375168,0,0,-0.08384730666875839,0,0.03353892266750336,0.03353892266750336,0,-0.13415569067001343,-0.03353892266750336,0,0,0.025154192000627518,0,-0.03353892266750336,0,0,0.03353892266750336,0.2515419125556946,0,0,-0.07546257972717285,0,0.16769461333751678,0.06707784533500671,0,-0.03353892266750336,-0.00838473066687584,0,0,0.01676946133375168,0,0,0,0,0,0.041923653334379196,0,-0.03353892266750336,0,0,0,0.1257709562778473,0,0,-0.03353892266750336,0,0.03353892266750336,0.01676946133375168,0,0,0,0,0,0.025154192000627518,0,-0.03353892266750336,0,0,0,0.00838473066687584,0,-0.03353892266750336,-0.03353892266750336,0,0,0.10900150239467621,0,-0.10061676800251007,-0.00838473066687584,0,0,0.01676946133375168,0,0,-0.03353892266750336,0,0.03353892266750336,0.025154192000627518,0,0,0,0,0.03353892266750336,0.050308384001255035,0,0,-0.041923653334379196,0,0,0.025154192000627518,0,-0.13415569067001343,-0.10900150239467621,0,0.03353892266750336,0.03353892266750336,0,0,0,0,0,0.01676946133375168,0,0,-0.06707784533500671,0,0.03353892266750336,0,0,0,-0.03353892266750336,0,0.06707784533500671,0.025154192000627518,0,-0.03353892266750336,-0.041923653334379196,0,0,0.10061676800251007,0,0,-0.03353892266750336,0,0.06707784533500671,0.00838473066687584,0,0,0,0,0.03353892266750336,0.1257709562778473,0,0,-0.025154192000627518,0,0,0.00838473066687584,0,0,0,0,0.03353892266750336,0.025154192000627518,0,0,0,0,0.03353892266750336,0.01676946133375168,0,-0.06707784533500671,-0.01676946133375168,0,0.06707784533500671,0.058693114668130875,0,0,-0.03353892266750336,0,0,0,0,-0.06707784533500671,-0.050308384001255035,0,0.13415569067001343,0.00838473066687584,0,0,0,0,0,0.01676946133375168,0,0,-0.01676946133375168,0,0,0.06707784533500671,0,0,0,0,0.03353892266750336,0,0,0,-0.08384730666875839,0,0,0.025154192000627518,0,-0.2347724586725235,0,0,0.20123353600502014,0.00838473066687584,0,-0.03353892266750336,-0.01676946133375168,0],"text":"<!-- Source: external/github.com/mist64_c64ref/src/c64io/c64io_mapc64.txt#BINOT-X-AND-3POKE-BYPEEKBY-AND-NOT-3CABI-OR-COCABI-38 -->\nTogether, these two locations control the frequency or pitch of the\n                          musical output of voice 1.

 Setting more than one of these bits will result in a logical ANDing of\n                          the waveforms.

Rather, the volume\n                          builds to a peak, levels off to an intermediate value, and then fades\n                          away.  This creates what is known as a volume envelope.\n\nThe first phase of the envelope, in which the volume builds to a peak,\n                          is known as the attack phase.  The second, in which it declines to an\n                          intermediate level, is called the decay phase.  The third, in which\n                          the intermediate level of volume is held, is known as the sustain\n                          period.  The final interval, in which the sound fades away, is called\n                          the release part of the

Source: external/github.com/mist64_c64ref/src/c64io/c64io_mapc64.txt#FREQUENCYREGISTER-VALUE5830Hz-12 -->\nColor mapping affords a convenient method of changing the color of the\n                          text display without changing the letters.  By POKEing the appropriate\n                          section of Color RAM, you can change the color of a whole section of\n                          text on the screen without affecting the content of the text.  You can\n                          even use this method to make letters disappear by changing their\n                          foreground colors to match the background (or by changing the\n                          background to match the foreground), and later make them reappear by\n                          changing them back, or by changing the background to a contrasting\n                          color.  An interesting example program which changes Color RAM quickly\n                          in BASIC can be found under the entry for 648

Source: external/github.com/mist64_c64ref/src/c64io/c64io_mapc64.txt#TIMELATCH-VALUECLOCK-SPEED-20 -->\nSince the CIA chip requires only enough addressing lines to handle 16\n                          registers, none of the higher bits are decoded when addressing the\n                          256-byte area that has been assigned to it.  The result is that every\n                          16-byte area in this 256-byte block is a mirror of every other.  Even\n                          so, for the sake of clarity in your programs it is advisable to use\n                          the base address of the chip, and not use the higher addresses to\n                          communicate with the chip.\n\n$DD00-$DD0F               Complex Interface Adapter (CIA) #2 Registers\n\nLocations 56576-56591 ($DD00-$DD0F) are used to address the Complex\n                          Interface Adapter chip #2 (CIA #2).  Since the chip itself is\n                          identical to CIA #1, which is addressed at 56320 ($DC00), the\n                          discussion here will be limited to the use which the 64 makes of this\n                          particular chip.  For more general information on the chip registers,\n                          please see the corresponding entries for CIA

         Instead of using each bit to control whether an individual dot will be\n                          foreground color (1) or background color (0), that mode breaks down\n                          each byte of shape data in four bit-pairs.  These bit pairs control\n                          whether a dot will be the color in Background Color Register #0 (00),\n                          the color in Background Color Register #1 (01), the color in\n                          Background Color Register #2 (10), or the color in the appropriate\n                          nybble of Color RAM (11).  Since each pair of bits controls one dot,\n                          each character is only four dots across.  To make up for this, each\n                          dot is twice as wide as a normal high-resolution

Sie beginnt beim VC 20 ab \n                     Speicherzelle 54161 ($D391), beim C 64 ab 45969 ($B391). Da hier prinzipiell \n                     dasselbe gilt wie oben, möchte ich nur kurz den Vorteil beleuchten, den \n                     derartige Vektoren haben. Eigentlich könnten wir direkt auf die im Vektor \n                     enthaltenen Adressen springen - wenn wir sie kennen.\n\nEin Sprung auf die Adresse des Vektors erlaubt uns jedoch immer die völlige \n                     Ignoranz seines Inhalts - und Commodore erlaubt die Änderung der Adressen im \n                     Basic-Übersetzer, wie es ja beim C 64 gegenüber dem VC 20 auch gemacht worden \n                     ist, ohne daß vorhandene Programme umgeschrieben werden müssen.\n\n$0007                Suchzeichen zur Prüfung von Texteingaben in Basic\n\nDiese Speicherzelle wird viel von denjenigen Basic-Routinen als \n                     Zwischenspeicher benutzt, die den direkt eingegebenen Text absuchen, um \n                     Steuerzeichen (Gänsefüße, Kommata, Doppelpunkte und die Zeilenbeendigung durch \n                     die RETURN-Taste) rechtzeitig zu erkennen. Normalerweise wird in der Zelle 7 \n                     der ASCII-Wert dieser Zeichen abgelegt. Die Speicherzelle 7 wird aber auch von \n                     anderen Basic-Routinen benutzt. Sie ist daher für den Programmierer praktisch \n                     nicht zu verwerten.\n\n$0008                Suchzeichen speziell für Befehlsende und

Source: external/github.com/mist64_c64ref/src/c64mem/c64mem_64er.txt#10-PRINT-PEEK245256PEEK246GOTO-10-13 -->\nNach einem Kaltstart (nach dem Einschalten oder nach dem Drücken der \n                     RESET-Taste) steht hier eine 4, das ergibt als Anfangsadresse 1024 (= 4*256). \n                     Beim VC 20 ohne Erweiterung steht dort eine 30. Daraus folgt, daß die \n                     Anfangsadresse bei 7680 (= 30*256) liegt.\n\nDer Bildschirmspeicher hat keinen absolut festen Platz. Innerhalb gewisser \n                     Grenzen kann er durch Verändern des Inhalts der Speicherzelle 53272 (36869 beim \n                     VC 20) verschoben werden. Die Methode dazu ist im Texteinschub näher \n                     beschrieben. Wichtig dabei ist, daß nach dem Verschieben der Inhalt der \n                     Speicherzelle 648 entsprechend geändert wird, damit auch das Betriebssystem die \n                     Verschiebung berücksichtigt.\n\nUmgekehrt kann aber dem Betriebssystem durch Ändern der Zahl in der \n                     Speicherzelle 648 mitgeteilt werden, daß es Zeichen in einen Speicherbereich \n                     bringen soll, der außerhalb des »offiziellen«, durch die Speicherzelle 53272 \n                     (36869) festgelegten Bildschirmspeichers liegt.\n\nZwei Beispiele sollen das verdeutlichen. Der PRINT-Befehl macht letztlich \n                     nichts anderes, als viele Zahlen in den Bildschirm- und den Farbspeicher zu \n                     POKEn.

Diese beiden Normen beziehen sich unter anderem auf die \n                     Anzahl der Zeilen und auf die Abtast-Geschwindigkeit des Lichtstrahls im \n                     Fernsehgerät oder im Monitor. Das Betriebssystem des C 64 überprüft gleich beim \n                     Einschalten, ob eine Rasterzeile 311 im angeschlossenen Sichtgerät vorhanden \n                     ist. Ist sie nicht vorhanden, muß alles auf die NTSC-Norm eingestellt werden, \n                     da diese nur 262 Rasterzeilen hat und mit einer internen Taktfrequenz von 14,3 \n                     MHz läuft. Ist eine Rasterzeile 311 vorhanden, wird auf PAL-Norm eingestellt \n                     mit einer Taktfrequenz von 17,7 MHz. Das Resultat dieses Tests wird in der \n                     Speicherzelle 678 gespeichert: als 0 für NTSC und 1 für PAL.\n\n$02A7-$02FF          nicht

Source: external/github.com/mist64_c64ref/src/c64mem/c64mem_64er.txt#90-DATA-7626199-5 -->\nDieser Vektor zeigt auf die Adresse 59953 ($EA31) - beim VC 20 auf 60095 \n                     ($EABF). Ab hier beginnt die Routine des Betriebssystems, die den IRQ-Interrupt \n                     ausführt. Die Bedeutung der verschiedenen Interrupts (Unterbrechungen), ihre \n                     Auslöser und Abläufe sind als Übersicht im Texteinschub Nr. 35 »Dem Computer \n                     ins Wort fallen« dargestellt.\n\nDie IRQ-Routine wird vom Timer A des Ein-/Ausgabe-Bausteins CIA #1 - beim VC 20 \n                     vom Timer 1 des Ein-/Ausgabe-Bausteins VIA #2 - ausgelöst, und zwar periodisch \n                     60mal in jeder Sekunde. In der Programmpause werden die im Texteinschub \n                     beschriebenen »Haushaltsarbeiten« durchgeführt.\n\nDieser Vektor eignet sich hervorragend für eigene Programmierzwecke, da er \n                     durch das Verbiegen auf eine andere Adresse seine gleichmäßige und \n                     hochfrequente Wiederkehr nicht verliert. Mit seiner Hilfe können also eigene \n                     Maschinenprogramme 60mal in der Sekunde in ein Programm eingeschoben werden - \n                     eine Methode, die deswegen den englischen Namen »Wedge« = Keil, erhalten hat. \n                     Zwei Vorbedingungen sind allerdings dabei zu

Source: external/github.com/mist64_c64ref/src/c64mem/c64mem_64er.txt#90-DATA-7626199-6 -->\n1. Da ein IRQ mit Sicherheit während des Verbiegens auftritt, muß er vorher \n                        abgeschaltet werden. Den Schlüssel dazu bietet die Speicherzelle 56334, die \n                        mit 0 gePOKEt den Interrupt abschaltet und mit POKE 56334,1 ihn wieder \n                        zuläßt. Beim VC 20 ist dies POKE 37116,127 beziehungsweise POKE 37116,192. \n                        Aber Vorsicht!! Da während eines IRQ-Interrupts auch die Tastatur abgefragt \n                        wird, kann das Abschalten nur innerhalb eines Programms erfolgen - während \n                        der Abschaltung ist die Tastatur tot.\n                     2. Am Ende eines »Wedge« muß der Sprung auf die alte IRQ-Adresse erfolgen, die \n                        ursprünglich in den Speicherzellen 788 bis 789 stand, damit - etwas \n                        verspätet zwar - die normalen Haushaltsarbeiten des IRQ nachgeholt werden \n                        können. Bei längeren Wedges wird daher die interne Uhr TI und TI$ etwas \n                        nachgehen.\n\nIch habe lange nach einem Beispiel gesucht. Ich kenne viele: Abfrage der \n                     Joysticks, Lautstärke von Tönen mit Funktionstasten steuern, von Basic \n                     unabhängige Laufschrift, um ein paar zu nennen. Aber alle haben einen ziemlich \n                     langen Maschinensprache-Teil. Ich bringe daher hier das kürzeste Beispiel, das \n                     ich kenne. Es stammt von Rügheimer und Spanik.\n\nDas Programm verändert dauernd die Farbe des

without checking for a previous I/O error. If the operation is\n               successful, the accumulator will hold the byte received from\n               the device. The contents of .X and .Y are preserved. The suc-\n               cess of the operation will be indicated by the value in the se-\n               rial status flag upon return. (See READST for details.)\n\nFor the routine to function properly, the serial device\n               must currently be a talker on the serial bus, which requires a\n               number of setup steps. Generally, it's preferable to use the\n               higher-level CHRFN routine

returning screen memory to its default position and set-\n               ting default screen and border colors. The routine also clears\n               the screen and homes the cursor. All processor registers are\n               affected.\n\nFor the 64 only, this routine initializes all VIC chip reg-\n               isters to their default values (that's done during the Kernal\n               IOINIT routine in the 128). For the 128, CINT clears both dis-\n               plays and redirects printing to the display indicated by the po-\n               sition of the 40/80 DISPLAY key. The 128 routine also sets\n               SID volume to zero and resets programmable function keys to\n               their default definitions. It does not, however, reinitialize the\n               80-column character set.

Un-\n               closed files may cause problems, particularly on disks, so this\n               routine is of limited usefulness. The 128 Kernal provides an\n               alternate routine that does properly close all files open to a se-\n               rial device. (See CLOSE_ALL.)\n\nThe JMP to the CLALL execution routine is by way of the\n               JCLALL indirect vector at $032C-$032D.

In addition, the 128 routine sets all\n               SID chip registers to zero and calls the Kernal DLCHR routine\n               to initialize the character set for the 80-column chip.","sourcePath":"external/github.com/mist64_c64ref/src/kernal/kernal_mlr.txt","sourceMtimeMs":1741819955000,"sourceUrl":"https://github.com/mist64/c64ref/blob/main/kernal_mlr.txt","sourceRepoUrl":"https://github.com/mist64/c64ref","license":"BSD-2-Clause","licenseSpdxId":"BSD-2-Clause","licenseName":"BSD 2-Clause \"Simplified\" License","licenseUrl":"https://github.com/mist64/c64ref/blob/main/LICENSE","attribution":"Source: mist64/c64ref (BSD-2-Clause)","origin":"external/github.com/mist64_c64ref/src/kernal/kernal_mlr.txt#FF84-IOINIT-IOINIT"},{"name":"github.com/mist64_c64ref/src/kernal/kernal_mlr.txt","language":"hardware","vector":[0,0,0,0,-0.029244989156723022,0,0.07798663526773453,0.019496658816933632,0,0,-0.029244989156723022,0,0.07798663526773453,0.029244989156723022,0,0,-0.019496658816933632,0,0.038993317633867264,0,0,0,-0.029244989156723022,0,0,0.029244989156723022,0,-0.038993317633867264,0,0,0,0.019496658816933632,0,0,0,0,0.038993317633867264,0.009748329408466816,0,0,0,0,0.07798663526773453,0.019496658816933632,0,0,-0.019496658816933632,0,0,0.009748329408466816,0,0,0,0,0.07798663526773453,0.009748329408466816,0,0,-0.019496658816933632,0,0.038993317633867264,0.048741649836301804,0,-0.038993317633867264,-0.009748329408466816,0,0,0.009748329408466816,0,0,-0.019496658816933632,0,0,0,0,0,-0.009748329408466816,0,0,0,0,-0.038993317633867264,0,0,0.07798663526773453,0,0,-0.19496659934520721,-0.15597327053546906,0,0.038993317633867264,0.019496658816933632,0,-0.07798663526773453,-0.06823831051588058,0,0.038993317633867264,0,0,0,-0.019496658816933632,0,0.35093986988067627,0.038993317633867264,0,-0.038993317633867264,0,0,0,0.07798663526773453,0,0,0,0,0.23395991325378418,0.019496658816933632,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.029244989156723022,0,0.38993319869041443,0,0,-0.11697995662689209,0,0,0,0.019496658816933632,0,0,-0.009748329408466816,0,0.038993317633867264,0.048741649836301804,0,0,0,0,0,0.009748329408466816,0,0,0,0,0.23395991325378418,0.038993317633867264,0,0,0,0,0.038993317633867264,0.029244989156723022,0,0,-0.019496658816933632,0,0.07798663526773453,0,0,-0.07798663526773453,0,0,0.038993317633867264,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.019496658816933632,0,-0.11697995662689209,-0.019496658816933632,0,0.07798663526773453,0.038993317633867264,0,-0.038993317633867264,-0.10723162442445755,0,0.11697995662689209,0.019496658816933632,0,-0.07798663526773453,-0.038993317633867264,0,0,0.019496658816933632,0,-0.038993317633867264,0,0,0.038993317633867264,0.17546993494033813,0,0,-0.09748329967260361,0,0,0.009748329408466816,0,0,-0.019496658816933632,0,0.038993317633867264,0.11697995662689209,0,0,0,0,0,0.019496658816933632,0,-0.07798663526773453,0,0,0.038993317633867264,0.2144632488489151,0,0,-0.058489978313446045,0,0.038993317633867264,0.009748329408466816,0,-0.07798663526773453,0,0,0.038993317633867264,0.019496658816933632,0,-0.038993317633867264,-0.009748329408466816,0,0.038993317633867264,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.12672828137874603,0,-0.038993317633867264,0,0,0,0.038993317633867264,0,0,0,0,0,0.038993317633867264,0,0,-0.038993317633867264,0,0,0.038993317633867264,0,-0.11697995662689209,0,0,0,0.009748329408466816,0,-0.07798663526773453,-0.06823831051588058,0,0,0.038993317633867264,0,0,-0.019496658816933632,0,0.15597327053546906,0.058489978313446045,0,0,-0.038993317633867264,0,0,0,0,0,-0.029244989156723022,0,0,0.038993317633867264,0,-0.038993317633867264,-0.048741649836301804,0,0,0.009748329408466816,0,0,-0.019496658816933632,0,0,0.029244989156723022,0,-0.038993317633867264,0,0,0.038993317633867264,0.08773496747016907,0,0,-0.048741649836301804,0,0.038993317633867264,0.019496658816933632,0,0,0,0,0,0.07798663526773453,0,0,-0.038993317633867264,0,0.038993317633867264,0.019496658816933632,0,0,-0.019496658816933632,0,0,0.11697995662689209,0,0,-0.029244989156723022,0,0,0,0,0,-0.019496658816933632,0,0.07798663526773453,0.009748329408466816,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.038993317633867264,0,0,0,0.058489978313446045,0,0,-0.058489978313446045,0,0,0.009748329408466816,0,0,-0.038993317633867264,0,0,0.019496658816933632,0,-0.3119465410709381,-0.019496658816933632,0,0.038993317633867264,0.08773496747016907,0,-0.07798663526773453,0,0],"text":"<!-- Source: external/github.com/mist64_c64ref/src/kernal/kernal_mlr.txt#FFB1-LISTEN-LISTEN -->\n$FFB1  LISTEN  LISTEN\n\nThis low-level serial I/O routine sends a LISTEN command to\n               a specified serial device.

If carry is set, the 16 two-byte address values\n               currently in the vectors will be copied to the table.","sourcePath":"external/github.com/mist64_c64ref/src/kernal/kernal_mlr.txt","sourceMtimeMs":1741819955000,"sourceUrl":"https://github.com/mist64/c64ref/blob/main/kernal_mlr.txt","sourceRepoUrl":"https://github.com/mist64/c64ref","license":"BSD-2-Clause","licenseSpdxId":"BSD-2-Clause","licenseName":"BSD 2-Clause \"Simplified\" License","licenseUrl":"https://github.com/mist64/c64ref/blob/main/LICENSE","attribution":"Source: mist64/c64ref (BSD-2-Clause)","origin":"external/github.com/mist64_c64ref/src/kernal/kernal_mlr.txt#FF8D-VECTOR-VECTOR"},{"name":"github.com/mist64_c64ref/src/kernal/kernal_mlr.txt","language":"hardware","vector":[0,0,0,0,-0.027020448818802834,0,0.03602726384997368,0.00900681596249342,0,-0.03602726384997368,-0.01801363192498684,0,0.07205452769994736,0.04503408074378967,0,-0.07205452769994736,-0.03602726384997368,0,0.03602726384997368,0,0,0,0,0,0.03602726384997368,0.04503408074378967,0,-0.03602726384997368,-0.01801363192498684,0,0.07205452769994736,0.01801363192498684,0,0,0,0,0.03602726384997368,0.00900681596249342,0,0,-0.03602726384997368,0,0.07205452769994736,0.00900681596249342,0,0,-0.01801363192498684,0,0.03602726384997368,0.00900681596249342,0,0,0,0,0.10808179527521133,0.00900681596249342,0,-0.03602726384997368,-0.00900681596249342,0,0,0.04503408074378967,0,-0.03602726384997368,-0.03602726384997368,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03602726384997368,0,0,-0.027020448818802834,0,0,0,0,-0.07205452769994736,-0.07205452769994736,0,0,0.01801363192498684,0,-0.21616359055042267,-0.19814996421337128,0,0.07205452769994736,0.03602726384997368,0,-0.03602726384997368,-0.05404089763760567,0,0.03602726384997368,0.00900681596249342,0,0,-0.01801363192498684,0,0.3242453932762146,0.027020448818802834,0,-0.07205452769994736,-0.01801363192498684,0,0,0.03602726384997368,0,0,-0.03602726384997368,0,0.03602726384997368,0.01801363192498684,0,0,-0.00900681596249342,0,0,0.01801363192498684,0,0,-0.027020448818802834,0,0.39629992842674255,0.04503408074378967,0,-0.07205452769994736,0,0,0,0.01801363192498684,0,0,0,0,0.03602726384997368,0.05404089763760567,0,0,-0.00900681596249342,0,0.03602726384997368,0.01801363192498684,0,0,0,0,0.1801363229751587,0.05404089763760567,0,0,-0.03602726384997368,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01801363192498684,0,0.10808179527521133,0,0,-0.03602726384997368,0,0,0.03602726384997368,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.01801363192498684,0,-0.03602726384997368,-0.04503408074378967,0,0.03602726384997368,0,0,0,-0.10808179527521133,0,0.10808179527521133,0.05404089763760567,0,-0.14410905539989471,-0.027020448818802834,0,0,0.01801363192498684,0,0,-0.03602726384997368,0,0.03602726384997368,0.171129509806633,0,0,-0.13510224223136902,0,0.07205452769994736,0.01801363192498684,0,0,-0.00900681596249342,0,0.03602726384997368,0.01801363192498684,0,0,0,0,0.03602726384997368,0.00900681596249342,0,-0.07205452769994736,-0.00900681596249342,0,0.03602726384997368,0.21616359055042267,0,0,-0.05404089763760567,0,0.03602726384997368,0.00900681596249342,0,-0.03602726384997368,0,0,0.03602726384997368,0.027020448818802834,0,-0.07205452769994736,-0.00900681596249342,0,0,0.03602726384997368,0,0,0,0,0,0.09907498210668564,0,-0.03602726384997368,0,0,0,0.01801363192498684,0,0,0,0,0,0.06304771453142166,0,0,-0.01801363192498684,0,0,0.04503408074378967,0,-0.14410905539989471,-0.00900681596249342,0,0.03602726384997368,0,0,-0.07205452769994736,-0.027020448818802834,0,0.03602726384997368,0.01801363192498684,0,0,0,0,0,0.05404089763760567,0,0,-0.07205452769994736,0,0,0,0,-0.03602726384997368,-0.01801363192498684,0,0,0.01801363192498684,0,-0.03602726384997368,-0.05404089763760567,0,0.03602726384997368,0.05404089763760567,0,0,-0.00900681596249342,0,0,0.027020448818802834,0,0,0,0,0.07205452769994736,0.09907498210668564,0,-0.03602726384997368,-0.05404089763760567,0,0,0.01801363192498684,0,0,0,0,0,0.027020448818802834,0,-0.07205452769994736,-0.01801363192498684,0,0,0.01801363192498684,0,0,-0.03602726384997368,0,0,0.09907498210668564,0,0,-0.01801363192498684,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01801363192498684,0,0.07205452769994736,0.00900681596249342,0,-0.03602726384997368,0,0,0,0.00900681596249342,0,0,0,0,0.07205452769994736,0.04503408074378967,0,-0.03602726384997368,-0.07205452769994736,0,0,0.01801363192498684,0,-0.14410905539989471,-0.03602726384997368,0,0.03602726384997368,0.04503408074378967,0,-0.39629992842674255,-0.00900681596249342,0,0.07205452769994736,0.00900681596249342,0,-0.03602726384997368,0,0],"text":"<!-- Source: external/github.com/mist64_c64ref/src/kernal/kernal_mlr.txt#FF50-DMACALL-DMACALL -->\n$FF50  DMA_CALL DMA_CALL\n\nThis routine passes a command to a DMA (Direct Memory Ac-\n               cess) device.

On the VIC-20, we might like to set the volume level of the sound generator by placing a value into location 3 L 8 7 8 (hex 3 DDE). On a Commodore 64, the screen's back ground color can be changed by manipulating address 5 3 5 3 1 (hex DO21). In each case, it's one specific address that we want; absolute addressing will do the job for us. And we will also use absolute addressing to reference the various RAM locations that we have picked for our own program \"var iables.\"\n\nZero-Page Mode\n\nA hexadecimal address such as $ 0 3 3 1 is sixteen bits long and takes up two bytes of memory.

-->\nbroken into subroutines, and the subroutines into even smaller subrou tines; this way, everything is neat and testable. If you should find a branch that won't reach, ask yourself whether it's time to break your program into smaller chunks before the logic gets too messy. By the liberal use of subroutines, you can arrange your code so that all branches are short and easily within reach. If you do break up the program structure, the branches will then always reach. It's up to you to choose your coding style, but you might give the question some thought.\nAn interesting aspect of relative addressing is that code containing branches is easy to relocate. A piece of code containing a branch to six locations ahead will work perfectly if the whole code is moved to a different location. This is not true of jumps and subroutine calls, or any code using absolute addressing-- if the location changes, the address must be changed.\nThe ROM Link--Jumps in Indirect Mode\nWe have mentioned the JMP instruction that will take the program to any specified address. JMP has another address mode: indirect addressing.\nIndirect addressing is signaled by the use of parentheses around the address. It works this way. An address is supplied, but it's not the one we will eventually use. We take this address, and at the location it specifies, we'll find the effective address, or the indirect address. The indirect ad dress is two bytes long, of course, and is stored in the usual 650x manner of low byte first.\nAn example will help to make things clear. Suppose that at address $D33C we have the instruction JMP ( $ 1 3 3 4 ) . The parentheses tell us that in direct addressing is involved.

-->\nshake your self-confidence. Many programmers have given up on machine\nlanguage because of a bad experience with SOV .\nIt works this way. The student writes a perfect program into the cassette buffer and saves it using the machine language monitor. Later, with a BASIC program in place, the student recalls the program and inadvertently\nmoves SOV to an impossible location. When BASIC runs, the variables\nwill start to be written behind the machine language program, ahead of the BASIC program. As more and more variables come into play, they creep relentlessly toward the BASIC coding.\nOur eager student-- with a perfect machine language program and a per fect BASIC program-- now decides to say RUN. The BASIC program runs for a while, and then grinds to a halt, usually with a crazy screen or reporting an error in a nonexistent line. We know what's happened, of course: the variables have started to write over the BASIC program. But our unfor\ntunate student doesn't know that. The command LIST is entered, and\nout comes nonsense.\nWhat goes through the programmer's mind at this time? \" I was so sure that the program is correct [in fact, it is]; but it's so bad that it's destroyed memory! I suppose that machine language is much more difficult than I thought.\"\nAnd the student loses hope and gives up, not knowing that there's only one small piece of information needed to fix everything up. This is only\none of the things that might go wrong when the SOV pointer is improperly\nplaced; even an attempt to change or save a BASIC program can cause system failure.\nSuch experiences destroy confidence. They are responsible for the myth that machine language is hard and only super-clever programmers can cope with it.\nThe Machine Language Monitor SAVE\nNow that we're becoming aware of the SOV pitfall, we're ready to discuss\nhow to save a program in machine language. You probably understand\nwhy I've been delaying this command until this time. The MLM save com\nmand typically goes\n�S \"PROGRAM\",Dl,033C,03L1\nThis would be the tape format. The command is .

PLP\n\nThere's a special test, used mostly for checking I A chips:\n\nB IT\n\nThe B I T test is used only for specific locations: no indexing is allowed. The high bit from the location being tested is transferred straight to the N flag. The next highest bit (bit b) goes straight to the V flag. Finally, the Z flag is set according to whether the location has any bits set that match bits set in the A register. Thus, we can check a location with B I T $ . . . . followed by B M I to test the high bit, or BVS to test bit b, or BNE to test any selected bit or group of bits.

command.","sourcePath":"external/retro-commodore.eu/files/development/c64-development/Butterfield_Machine_Language_for_the_Commodore_64_and_other_Commodore_Computers.ocr.txt","sourceMtimeMs":1761327713592,"origin":"external/retro-commodore.eu/files/development/c64-development/Butterfield_Machine_Language_for_the_Commodore_64_and_other_Commodore_Computers.ocr.txt#MACHINE-LANGUAGE-FOR-COMMODORE-MACHINES-2"},{"name":"retro-commodore.eu/files/development/c64-development/Butterfield_Machine_Language_for_the_Commodore_64_and_other_Commodore_Computers.ocr.txt","language":"hardware","vector":[0.03901185840368271,0.01462944783270359,0,-0.019505929201841354,-0.03901185840368271,0,0.05851779133081436,0.01462944783270359,0,-0.019505929201841354,-0.004876482300460339,0,0.019505929201841354,0.009752964600920677,0,-0.07802371680736542,-0.01462944783270359,0,0.03901185840368271,0.009752964600920677,0,-0.019505929201841354,-0.05364130809903145,0,0.03901185840368271,0.019505929201841354,0,0,-0.004876482300460339,0,0,0.019505929201841354,0,0,-0.01462944783270359,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.09752964973449707,0.024382412433624268,0,0,-0.019505929201841354,0,0,0.01462944783270359,0,-0.03901185840368271,-0.019505929201841354,0,0.019505929201841354,0.01462944783270359,0,0,-0.019505929201841354,0,0.019505929201841354,0.07802371680736542,0,0,-0.01462944783270359,0,0.07802371680736542,0.009752964600920677,0,-0.019505929201841354,-0.08290020376443863,0,0.07802371680736542,0.009752964600920677,0,0,-0.009752964600920677,0,0.03901185840368271,0.009752964600920677,0,-0.03901185840368271,-0.02925889566540718,0,0,0.02925889566540718,0,-0.11703558266162872,-0.13654151558876038,0,0,0.009752964600920677,0,-0.03901185840368271,-0.02925889566540718,0,0,0.019505929201841354,0,0,-0.009752964600920677,0,0.6046838164329529,0.03901185840368271,0,0,-0.009752964600920677,0,0,0.034135378897190094,0,-0.07802371680736542,-0.04388834163546562,0,0.019505929201841354,0.024382412433624268,0,-0.019505929201841354,-0.009752964600920677,0,0,0.019505929201841354,0,0,0,0,0.2145652323961258,0,0,-0.09752964973449707,0,0,0,0.004876482300460339,0,-0.019505929201841354,-0.019505929201841354,0,0.05851779133081436,0.05851779133081436,0,-0.019505929201841354,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.024382412433624268,0,0.15604743361473083,0.009752964600920677,0,-0.03901185840368271,0,0,0,0.01462944783270359,0,0,-0.004876482300460339,0,0,0.03901185840368271,0,-0.019505929201841354,-0.019505929201841354,0,0,0.04388834163546562,0,0,-0.009752964600920677,0,0.019505929201841354,0.05364130809903145,0,-0.15604743361473083,-0.024382412433624268,0,0.05851779133081436,0,0,-0.019505929201841354,-0.09752964973449707,0,0.03901185840368271,0,0,-0.05851779133081436,-0.019505929201841354,0,0,0.004876482300460339,0,-0.05851779133081436,-0.01462944783270359,0,0,0.3169713616371155,0,-0.019505929201841354,-0.06827075779438019,0,0.07802371680736542,0.004876482300460339,0,-0.019505929201841354,-0.048764824867248535,0,0,0.019505929201841354,0,0,-0.01462944783270359,0,0.05851779133081436,0.01462944783270359,0,-0.03901185840368271,-0.004876482300460339,0,0.05851779133081436,0.11215909570455551,0,0,-0.06827075779438019,0,0.019505929201841354,0.009752964600920677,0,0,-0.01462944783270359,0,0.03901185840368271,0.03901185840368271,0,-0.019505929201841354,-0.009752964600920677,0,0.03901185840368271,0,0,-0.019505929201841354,0,0,0.03901185840368271,0.07802371680736542,0,-0.03901185840368271,-0.019505929201841354,0,0,0.024382412433624268,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.019505929201841354,0,0,0.004876482300460339,0,-0.03901185840368271,0,0,0,0.01462944783270359,0,0,-0.07802371680736542,0,0.03901185840368271,0.048764824867248535,0,0,-0.01462944783270359,0,0.09752964973449707,0.03901185840368271,0,-0.019505929201841354,-0.02925889566540718,0,0.019505929201841354,0.009752964600920677,0,0,-0.03901185840368271,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03901185840368271,0,0,0.03901185840368271,0,0,-0.019505929201841354,0,0.019505929201841354,0,0,-0.07802371680736542,0,0,0.03901185840368271,0.1804298460483551,0,0,-0.019505929201841354,0,0,0.02925889566540718,0,-0.019505929201841354,-0.019505929201841354,0,0,0.01462944783270359,0,0,-0.004876482300460339,0,0.019505929201841354,0.019505929201841354,0,-0.019505929201841354,-0.009752964600920677,0,0,0.0731472373008728,0,-0.03901185840368271,-0.034135378897190094,0,0.019505929201841354,0.019505929201841354,0,-0.03901185840368271,-0.024382412433624268,0,0.13654151558876038,0.01462944783270359,0,-0.019505929201841354,-0.004876482300460339,0,0,0,0,-0.15604743361473083,0,0,0,0.03901185840368271,0,0,-0.02925889566540718,0,0.019505929201841354,0,0,-0.05851779133081436,0,0,0.05851779133081436,0.019505929201841354,0,-0.27308303117752075,-0.004876482300460339,0,0.019505929201841354,0.048764824867248535,0,-0.03901185840368271,-0.009752964600920677,0],"text":"<!--

to CRT or TV-type raster scan displays.\nHorizontal Total (R0)\nThis 8-bit register contains the total of displayed and non-displayed char acters, minus one, per horizontal line. The frequency of HSYNC is thus determined by this register.\nHorizontal Displayed (R1)\nThis 8-bit register contains the number of displayed characters per hori zontal line.\nHorizontal Sync Position (R2)\nThis 8-bit register contains the position of the HSYNC on the horizontal line, in terms of the character location number on the line.

I\n\n285\n\nMOB-MOB COLLISION register 30 ($1E) will be set to \" 1\" for both colliding MOBs. As a collision between two (or more) MOBs occurs, the MOB-MOB collision bit for each collided MOB will be set. The collision bits remain set until a read of the collision register, when all bits are automatically cleared. MOBs collisions are detected even if positioned off-screen.\n2) The second type of collision is a MOB-DATA collision between a MOB and foreground display data from the character or bit map modes. The MOBDATA COLLISION register 31 ($1F) has a bit (MnD) for each MOB which is set to \" 1\" when both the MOB and non-background display data are coincident. Again, the coincidence of only transparent data does not generate a collision. For special applications, the display data from the 0-1 multicolor bit pair also does not cause a collision. This feature permits their use as background display data without interfering with true MOB collisions. A MOBDATA collision can occur off-screen in the horizontal direction if actual display data has been scrolled to an off-screen position (see scrolling).

Pen\nThe light pen input latches the current screen position into a pair of reg isters (LPX.LPY) on a low-going edge. The X position register 19 ($13) will contain the 8 MSB of the X position at the time of transition. Since the X position is defined by a 512-state counter (9 bits) resolution to 2 hori zontal dots is provided. Similarly, the Y position is latched to its register 20 ($14) but here 8 bits provide single raster resolution within the visible display. The light pen latch may be triggered only once per frame, and subsequent triggers within the same frame will have no effect. Therefore, you must take several samples before turning the light pen to the screen (3 or more samples, average), depending upon the characteristics of your light pen.\nRaster Register\nThe raster register is a dual-function register. A read of the raster register 18 ($12) returns the lower 8 bits of the current raster position (the M SBRC8 is located in register 17 ($11)). The raster register can be interrogated to implement display changes outside the visible area to prevent display flicker. The visible display window is from raster 51 through raster 251 ($033-$0FB). A write to the raster bits (including RC8) is latched for use in an internal raster compare. When the current raster matches the written value, the raster interrupt latch is set.","sourcePath":"external/retro-commodore.eu/files/development/c64-development/Butterfield_Machine_Language_for_the_Commodore_64_and_other_Commodore_Computers.ocr.txt","sourceMtimeMs":1761327713592,"origin":"external/retro-commodore.eu/files/development/c64-development/Butterfield_Machine_Language_for_the_Commodore_64_and_other_Commodore_Computers.ocr.txt#APPENDIX-I"},{"name":"retro-commodore.eu/files/development/c64-development/Butterfield_Machine_Language_for_the_Commodore_64_and_other_Commodore_Computers.ocr.txt","language":"hardware","vector":[0.06668055802583694,0.02500521019101143,0,0,-0.0583454892039299,0,0,0.008335069753229618,0,0,-0.008335069753229618,0,0.03334027901291847,0.041675351560115814,0,0,-0.008335069753229618,0,0.06668055802583694,0,0,0,-0.03334027901291847,0,0.06668055802583694,0.008335069753229618,0,-0.06668055802583694,-0.02500521019101143,0,0.16670140624046326,0.06668055802583694,0,0,-0.008335069753229618,0,0,0.016670139506459236,0,0,-0.016670139506459236,0,0.06668055802583694,0.06668055802583694,0,0,-0.02500521019101143,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03334027901291847,0.016670139506459236,0,0,-0.03334027901291847,0,0.1333611160516739,0,0,-0.06668055802583694,0,0,0,0.03334027901291847,0,0,-0.008335069753229618,0,0,0.07501562684774399,0,0,-0.008335069753229618,0,0.06668055802583694,0.008335069753229618,0,-0.03334027901291847,0,0,0.03334027901291847,0.09168577194213867,0,-0.2333819568157196,-0.05001042038202286,0,0,0.016670139506459236,0,-0.03334027901291847,-0.016670139506459236,0,0,0.03334027901291847,0,-0.03334027901291847,-0.008335069753229618,0,0.40008336305618286,0.016670139506459236,0,0,-0.02500521019101143,0,0,0.03334027901291847,0,-0.1333611160516739,-0.008335069753229618,0,0.03334027901291847,0.03334027901291847,0,0,-0.008335069753229618,0,0.03334027901291847,0.03334027901291847,0,0,-0.03334027901291847,0,0.16670140624046326,0.10002084076404572,0,-0.2333819568157196,0,0,0,0,0,-0.16670140624046326,-0.008335069753229618,0,0,0.03334027901291847,0,0,-0.008335069753229618,0,0,0.03334027901291847,0,-0.03334027901291847,0,0,0.20004168152809143,0.02500521019101143,0,-0.03334027901291847,0,0,0.03334027901291847,0.10002084076404572,0,-0.03334027901291847,-0.03334027901291847,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03334027901291847,-0.016670139506459236,0,0.10002084076404572,0.03334027901291847,0,-0.16670140624046326,-0.016670139506459236,0,0.03334027901291847,0.03334027901291847,0,-0.03334027901291847,-0.1166909784078598,0,0.03334027901291847,0.016670139506459236,0,-0.03334027901291847,-0.016670139506459236,0,0,0,0,-0.06668055802583694,-0.016670139506459236,0,0.03334027901291847,0.21671181917190552,0,-0.03334027901291847,-0.02500521019101143,0,0,0,0,-0.03334027901291847,-0.07501562684774399,0,0,0.03334027901291847,0,-0.06668055802583694,0,0,0,0.016670139506459236,0,-0.10002084076404572,0,0,0,0.09168577194213867,0,0,-0.1166909784078598,0,0.06668055802583694,0.016670139506459236,0,0,-0.08335070312023163,0,0,0.016670139506459236,0,0,-0.016670139506459236,0,0,0.041675351560115814,0,-0.03334027901291847,-0.016670139506459236,0,0.16670140624046326,0.10002084076404572,0,-0.03334027901291847,-0.016670139506459236,0,0.03334027901291847,0.03334027901291847,0,0,-0.016670139506459236,0,0.2333819568157196,0,0,0,0,0,0.06668055802583694,0.008335069753229618,0,0,-0.016670139506459236,0,0,0.08335070312023163,0,-0.03334027901291847,-0.10002084076404572,0,0.06668055802583694,0.016670139506459236,0,-0.10002084076404572,-0.016670139506459236,0,0.06668055802583694,0.016670139506459236,0,-0.03334027901291847,-0.016670139506459236,0,0,0.016670139506459236,0,-0.03334027901291847,-0.041675351560115814,0,0,0.02500521019101143,0,0,-0.07501562684774399,0,0.06668055802583694,0,0,0,-0.02500521019101143,0,0,0,0,-0.03334027901291847,-0.041675351560115814,0,0,0.10002084076404572,0,-0.03334027901291847,-0.05001042038202286,0,0.1333611160516739,0,0,0,-0.03334027901291847,0,0.03334027901291847,0.041675351560115814,0,0,0,0,0.1333611160516739,0.008335069753229618,0,0,0,0,0,0.041675351560115814,0,0,-0.07501562684774399,0,0,0.08335070312023163,0,-0.06668055802583694,-0.0583454892039299,0,0,0.016670139506459236,0,0,0,0,0.06668055802583694,0.1166909784078598,0,0,-0.008335069753229618,0,0.06668055802583694,0.08335070312023163,0,0,-0.008335069753229618,0,0,0.008335069753229618,0,0,-0.02500521019101143,0,0.06668055802583694,0.03334027901291847,0,-0.10002084076404572,-0.05001042038202286,0,0,0.03334027901291847,0,-0.03334027901291847,-0.02500521019101143,0],"text":"<!-- Source: external/retro-commodore.eu/files/development/c64-development/Butterfield_Machine_Language_for_the_Commodore_64_and_other_Commodore_Computers.ocr.txt#APPENDIX-I-2 -->\nInterrupt Register\nThe interrupt register shows the status of the four sources of interrupt.

-->\nTo enable an interrupt request to set the IRQ/ output to \"0,\" the corre sponding interrupt enable bit in register 26 ($1 A) must be set to \" 1 Once an interrupt latch has been set, the latch may be cleared only by writing a \" 1\" to the desired latch in the interrupt register. This feature allows selective handling of video interrupts without software required to \" re member\" active interrupts.\nDynamic Ram Refresh\nA dynamic ram refresh controller is built into the 6566/6567 devices. Five 8-bit row addresses are refreshed every raster line. This rate guarantees a maximum delay of 2.02 ms between the refresh of any single row address in a 128 refresh scheme. (The maximum delay is 3.66 ms in a 256 address refresh scheme.) This refresh is totally transparent to the system, since the refresh occurs during Phase 1 of the system clock. The 6567 generates both RAS/ and CAS/ which are normally connected directly to the dynamic rams. RAS/ and CAS/ are generated for every Phase 2 and every video data access (including refresh) so that external clock generation is not required.\nReset\nThe reset bit (RES) in register 22 ($16) is not used for normal operation. Therefore it should be set to \"0\" when initializing the video chip. When set to a \" 1 the entire operation of the video chip is suspended, including video outputs and sync, memory refresh, and system bus access.\nTheory of Operation\nSystem Interface\nThe 6566/6567 video controller devices interact with the system data bus in a special way. A 65XX system requires the system buses only during the Phase 2 (clock high) portion of the cycle. The 6566/6567 devices take advantage of this feature by normally accessing system memory during the Phase 1 (clock low) portion of the clock cycle. Therefore, operations such as character data fetches and memory refresh are totally transparent to the processor and do not reduce the processor throughput.

-->\nto peak amplitude in 16 linear steps, with a SUSTAIN value of 0 selecting zero amplitude and a SUSTAIN value of 15 ($F) selecting the peak am plitude. A SUSTAIN value of 8 would cause Voice 1 to SUSTAIN at an amplitude one-half the peak amplitude reached by the ATTACK cycle.\nBits 0 -3 (RLS0-RLS3) select 1 of 16 RELEASE rates for the Envelope Generator. The RELEASE cycle follows the SUSTAIN cycle when the Gate bit is reset to zero. At this time, the output of Voice 1 will fall from the SUSTAIN amplitude to zero amplitude at the selected RELEASE rate. The 16 RELEASE rates are identical to the DECAY rates.\nNOTE: The cycling of the Envelope Generator can be altered at any point via the Gate bit. The Envelope Generator can be Gated and Released without restriction. For example, if the Gate bit is reset before the envelope has finished the ATTACK cycle, the RELEASE cycle will immediately begin, starting from whatever amplitude had been reached. If the envelope is then gated again (before the RE LEASE cycle has reached zero amplitude), another ATTACK cycle will begin, starting from whatever amplitude had been reached. This technique can be used to generate complex amplitude envelopes via real-time software control.\nVoice 2\nRegisters 07-$0D control Voice 2 and are functionally identical to registers 00-06 with these exceptions:\n1) When selected, SYNC synchronizes Oscillator 2 with Oscillator 1. 2) When selected, RING MOD replaces the Triangle output of Oscillator 2 with\nthe ring modulated combination of Oscillators 2 and 1.\nVoice 3\nRegisters $0E-$14 control Voice 3 and are functionally identical to reg isters 00-06 with these exceptions:\n1) When selected, SYNC synchronizes Oscillator 3 with Oscillator 2. 2) When selected, RING MOD replaces the Triangle output of Oscillator 3 with\nthe ring modulated combination of Oscillators 3 and 2.\nTypical operation of a voice consists of selecting the desired parameters: frequency, waveform, effects (SYNC, RING MOD) and envelope rates, then gating the voice whenever the sound is desired. The sound can be sustained for any length of time and terminated by clearing the Gate bit.","sourcePath":"external/retro-commodore.eu/files/development/c64-development/Butterfield_Machine_Language_for_the_Commodore_64_and_other_Commodore_Computers.ocr.txt","sourceMtimeMs":1761327713592,"origin":"external/retro-commodore.eu/files/development/c64-development/Butterfield_Machine_Language_for_the_Commodore_64_and_other_Commodore_Computers.ocr.txt#MACHINE-LANGUAGE-FOR-COMMODORE-MACHINES-2"},{"name":"retro-commodore.eu/files/development/c64-development/Butterfield_Machine_Language_for_the_Commodore_64_and_other_Commodore_Computers.ocr.txt","language":"hardware","vector":[0.03467990830540657,0.017339954152703285,0,-0.011559969745576382,-0.06646982580423355,0,0.13871963322162628,0.014449961483478546,0,-0.023119939491152763,-0.017339954152703285,0,0.023119939491152763,0.017339954152703285,0,-0.21963942050933838,-0.04912986978888512,0,0.023119939491152763,0.04912986978888512,0,-0.011559969745576382,0,0,0,0.017339954152703285,0,0,-0.005779984872788191,0,0.09247975796461105,0.06068984046578407,0,-0.03467990830540657,-0.014449961483478546,0,0.011559969745576382,0.04912986978888512,0,-0.057799845933914185,-0.020229946821928024,0,0.04623987898230553,0.06357983499765396,0,-0.011559969745576382,-0.020229946821928024,0,0.011559969745576382,0,0,-0.03467990830540657,-0.008669977076351643,0,0.0809197872877121,0.020229946821928024,0,-0.06935981661081314,-0.008669977076351643,0,0.023119939491152763,0.023119939491152763,0,0,-0.03756989911198616,0,0.10403972864151001,0.005779984872788191,0,0,0,0,0.057799845933914185,0.03756989911198616,0,0,-0.014449961483478546,0,0,0.020229946821928024,0,-0.10403972864151001,-0.026009932160377502,0,0.011559969745576382,0.005779984872788191,0,-0.10403972864151001,-0.23119938373565674,0,0.011559969745576382,0.04045989364385605,0,-0.04623987898230553,-0.020229946821928024,0,0,0.04045989364385605,0,0,-0.03756989911198616,0,0.13871963322162628,0.06935981661081314,0,-0.011559969745576382,-0.023119939491152763,0,0.057799845933914185,0.020229946821928024,0,-0.09247975796461105,-0.11559969186782837,0,0.023119939491152763,0.017339954152703285,0,-0.023119939491152763,-0.014449961483478546,0,0.15027959644794464,0.005779984872788191,0,0,-0.0028899924363940954,0,0.27743926644325256,0.04912986978888512,0,-0.09247975796461105,-0.020229946821928024,0,0,0.023119939491152763,0,0,-0.028899922966957092,0,0,0.03178991749882698,0,0,-0.005779984872788191,0,0,0.011559969745576382,0,-0.023119939491152763,-0.017339954152703285,0,0.0809197872877121,0.057799845933914185,0,-0.03467990830540657,-0.04045989364385605,0,0,0.03756989911198616,0,-0.15027959644794464,0,0,0,0.052019864320755005,0,-0.023119939491152763,-0.0028899924363940954,0,0.04623987898230553,0.03467990830540657,0,-0.011559969745576382,-0.0028899924363940954,0,0.023119939491152763,0.011559969745576382,0,-0.19651947915554047,-0.06646982580423355,0,0.011559969745576382,0.008669977076351643,0,-0.04623987898230553,-0.052019864320755005,0,0.04623987898230553,0.023119939491152763,0,-0.17339953780174255,-0.023119939491152763,0,0.057799845933914185,0.005779984872788191,0,0,-0.011559969745576382,0,0,0.06935981661081314,0,-0.023119939491152763,-0.11559969186782837,0,0.19651947915554047,0.04623987898230553,0,-0.057799845933914185,-0.054909855127334595,0,0.057799845933914185,0.020229946821928024,0,-0.03467990830540657,-0.014449961483478546,0,0.04623987898230553,0.10981971025466919,0,-0.0809197872877121,-0.005779984872788191,0,0,0.14449961483478546,0,-0.011559969745576382,-0.10114973038434982,0,0.03467990830540657,0.005779984872788191,0,-0.011559969745576382,-0.0028899924363940954,0,0,0,0,-0.03467990830540657,0,0,0,0.023119939491152763,0,0,-0.020229946821928024,0,0.011559969745576382,0.04334988445043564,0,-0.057799845933914185,-0.03178991749882698,0,0.03467990830540657,0.011559969745576382,0,-0.011559969745576382,-0.07802979648113251,0,0.023119939491152763,0.0028899924363940954,0,-0.04623987898230553,-0.020229946821928024,0,0.023119939491152763,0.04334988445043564,0,-0.011559969745576382,-0.023119939491152763,0,0.09247975796461105,0.017339954152703285,0,-0.12715966999530792,-0.09825973957777023,0,0,0.03178991749882698,0,-0.04623987898230553,-0.023119939491152763,0,0.03467990830540657,0.03756989911198616,0,-0.023119939491152763,-0.08669976890087128,0,0.023119939491152763,0.028899922966957092,0,-0.03467990830540657,-0.026009932160377502,0,0.023119939491152763,0.0028899924363940954,0,-0.011559969745576382,-0.03756989911198616,0,0.011559969745576382,0.10114973038434982,0,-0.011559969745576382,-0.04045989364385605,0,0.06935981661081314,0.028899922966957092,0,0,-0.017339954152703285,0,0.03467990830540657,0.057799845933914185,0,0,-0.04334988445043564,0,0.023119939491152763,0.014449961483478546,0,0,-0.028899922966957092,0,0.06935981661081314,0.023119939491152763,0,-0.023119939491152763,-0.011559969745576382,0,0.10403972864151001,0.03756989911198616,0,0,-0.017339954152703285,0,0,0.06935981661081314,0,-0.011559969745576382,-0.023119939491152763,0,0.023119939491152763,0.005

$1B)\nThis register allows the microprocessor to read the upper 8 output bits of Oscillator 3. The character of the numbers generated is directly related to the waveform selected. If the Sawtooth waveform of Oscillator 3 is se lected, this register will present a series of numbers incrementing from 0 to 255 ($FF) at a rate determined by the frequency of Oscillator 3. If the Triangle waveform is selected, the output will increment from 0 up to 255, then decrement down to 0. If the Pulse waveform is selected, the output will jump between 0 and 255. Selecting the Noise waveform will produce a series of random numbers, therefore, this register can be used as a random number generator for games. There are numerous timing and sequencing applications for the OSC 3 register, however, the chief function is probably that of a modulation generator. The numbers generated by this register can be added, via software, to the Oscillator or Filter Fre quency registers or the Pulse Width registers in real-time. Many dynamic effects can be generated in this manner. Siren-like sounds can be created by adding the OSC 3 Sawtooth output to the frequency control of another oscillator. Synthesizer \"Sample and Hold\" effects can be produced by adding the OSC 3 Noise output to the Filter Frequency control registers. Vibrato can be produced by setting Oscillator 3 to a frequency around 7 Hz and adding the OSC 3 Triangle output (with proper scaling) to the Frequency control of another oscillator. An unlimited range of effects are available by altering the frequency of Oscillator 3 and scaling the OSC 3 output. Normally, when Oscillator 3 is used for modulation, the audio output of Voice 3 should be eliminated (3 OFF = 1).\nENV 3 (Register $1C)\nSame as OSC 3, but this register allows the microprocessor to read the output of the Voice 3 Envelope Generator. This output can be added to the Filter Frequency to produce harmonic envelopes, WAH-WAH, and similar effects. \" Phaser\" sounds can be created by adding this output to the frequency control registers of an oscillator.

DESCRIPTION\n\n1. IP = 0 No Priority\nAll interrupt information latched into interrupt latch register (ILR) is im mediately transferred into active interrupt register (AIR) and IRQ is pulled low. Upon read of interrupt the IRQ is reset high and the appropriate bit(s) of the interrupt latch register is cleared by exclusive OR-ing. The ILR with AIR (ILR0AIR). After the appropriate interrupt request has been serviced a Write to the AIR will clear it and initiate a new interrupt sequence if any interrupts were received during previous interrupt servicing. In this nonprioritized mode it is possible for two or more interrupts to occur simul taneously and be transferred to the AIR. If this occurs it is a software effort to recognize this and act accordingly.\n\n2. IP = 1 Interrupts Prioritized\n\nIn this mode the Interrupt Inputs are prioritized in the following order l4 > l3 > l2 > li > lo\n\nIn this mode only one bit of the AIR can be set at any one time. If an interrupt occurs it is latched into the interrupt latch register, the IRQ line is pulled low and the appropriate bit of the AIR is set. To understand fully the operation of the priority interrupts it is easiest to consider the following examples.\n\nA. The first case is the simplest.

Processor recognizes IRQ and reads AIR to determine which\n\ninterrupt occurred.___\n\n5. Bit L is reset and IRQ is reset high.\n\n6. Processor begins servicing I, interrupt and the l2 interrupt is re\n\nceived.\n\n___\n\n7. A2 is set, A1 is reset low and IRQ is pulled low.\n\n8. Processor has not yet completed servicing L interrupt so this\n\nroutine will be automatically stacked in 6500 stack queue when\n\nnew IRQ for l2 of interrupt is received.\n\n9. Processor reads AIR to determine l2 interrupt occurrence and bit\n\nl2 of interrupt latch is reset.\n\n10. Processor services l2 interrupt, clears A2 by writing AIR and re\n\nturns from interrupt. Returning from interrupt causes 650X pro\n\ncessor to resume servicing L interrupt.\n\n11. Upon clearing A2 bit in AIR, the A, bit will not be restored to a\n\none. Internal circuitry will prevent a lower priority interrupt from\n\ninterrupting the resumed I,.\n\nC. The third case occurs when an interrupt has been received and a lower priority interrupt occurs. 1. Interrupt L is received and latched. 2. IRQ is pulled low and A1 is set high. 3. Processor recognizes IRQ and reads AIR to determine that I, in terrupt occurred. 4. Processor logic servicing I, interrupt during which l0 interrupt oc curs and is latched. 5. Upon completion of I, interrupt routine the processor writes AIR to clear A1to signal 6525 that interrupt service is complete. 6. Latch l0 interrupt is transferred to AIR and IRQ is pulled low to begin new interrupt sequence.","sourcePath":"external/retro-commodore.eu/files/development/c64-development/Butterfield_Machine_Language_for_the_Commodore_64_and_other_Commodore_Computers.ocr.txt","sourceMtimeMs":1761327713592,"origin":"external/retro-commodore.eu/files/development/c64-development/Butterfield_Machine_Language_for_the_Commodore_64_and_other_Commodore_Computers.ocr.txt#MACHINE-LANGUAGE-FOR-COMMODORE-MACHINES"},{"name":"retro-commodore.eu/files/development/c64-development/Butterfield_Machine_Language_for_the_Commodore_64_and_other_Commodore_Computers.ocr.txt","language":"hardware","vector":[0.19659587740898132,0.008191494271159172,0,0,-0.03276597708463669,0,0.09829793870449066,0.04095747321844101,0,0,0,0,0.03276597708463669,0.008191494271159172,0,0,-0.057340461760759354,0,0.09829793870449066,0.008191494271159172,0,0,0,0,0,0.016382988542318344,0,0,-0.008191494271159172,0,0.03276597708463669,0.008191494271159172,0,-0.09829793870449066,-0.04095747321844101,0,0,0,0,-0.09829793870449066,-0.03276597708463669,0,0.06553195416927338,0.04914896935224533,0,-0.03276597708463669,-0.057340461760759354,0,0,0.016382988542318344,0,0,-0.016382988542318344,0,0.16382989287376404,0.008191494271159172,0,0,0,0,0.13106390833854675,0.04095747321844101,0,-0.06553195416927338,0,0,0,0.04914896935224533,0,0,-0.03276597708463669,0,0.03276597708463669,0,0,-0.03276597708463669,0,0,0.03276597708463669,0.016382988542318344,0,-0.06553195416927338,-0.016382988542318344,0,0,0.016382988542318344,0,-0.03276597708463669,-0.08191494643688202,0,0.09829793870449066,0,0,-0.06553195416927338,-0.016382988542318344,0,0.06553195416927338,0.13925540447235107,0,0,0,0,0.39319175481796265,0.04914896935224533,0,-0.09829793870449066,-0.008191494271159172,0,0,0.04095747321844101,0,0,0,0,0.06553195416927338,0.04914896935224533,0,0,0,0,0,0.016382988542318344,0,0,0,0,0.3276597857475281,0.016382988542318344,0,0,-0.04914896935224533,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04914896935224533,0,0,0.04095747321844101,0,-0.03276597708463669,-0.016382988542318344,0,0.03276597708463669,0,0,0,-0.008191494271159172,0,0.16382989287376404,0.08191494643688202,0,-0.06553195416927338,-0.016382988542318344,0,0,0.09010644257068634,0,-0.03276597708463669,-0.03276597708463669,0,0.03276597708463669,0.008191494271159172,0,0,0,0,0,0.016382988542318344,0,-0.03276597708463669,-0.016382988542318344,0,0.03276597708463669,0.03276597708463669,0,-0.13106390833854675,-0.03276597708463669,0,0.03276597708463669,0.024574484676122665,0,0,-0.03276597708463669,0,0.03276597708463669,0.04914896935224533,0,-0.22936184704303741,-0.03276597708463669,0,0.03276597708463669,0.04095747321844101,0,0,-0.008191494271159172,0,0,0.19659587740898132,0,-0.03276597708463669,-0.09010644257068634,0,0.03276597708463669,0,0,-0.09829793870449066,-0.008191494271159172,0,0,0.08191494643688202,0,0,0,0,0,0.024574484676122665,0,-0.22936184704303741,0,0,0,0.17202138900756836,0,-0.06553195416927338,0,0,0.03276597708463669,0.024574484676122665,0,0,0,0,0.03276597708463669,0,0,0,-0.016382988542318344,0,0,0.024574484676122665,0,0,-0.024574484676122665,0,0,0.08191494643688202,0,0,-0.057340461760759354,0,0,0.016382988542318344,0,0,-0.024574484676122665,0,0.06553195416927338,0.016382988542318344,0,0,0,0,0,0.04095747321844101,0,0,-0.016382988542318344,0,0.16382989287376404,0.04914896935224533,0,0,-0.08191494643688202,0,0,0.016382988542318344,0,-0.03276597708463669,0,0,0.09829793870449066,0.024574484676122665,0,0,-0.12287241965532303,0,0,0.024574484676122665,0,0,-0.016382988542318344,0,0.06553195416927338,0,0,0,-0.024574484676122665,0,0,0.04095747321844101,0,0,-0.06553195416927338,0,0,0.016382988542318344,0,0,0,0,0.03276597708463669,0.09829793870449066,0,0,-0.13925540447235107,0,0,0,0,-0.03276597708463669,-0.03276597708463669,0,0,0.03276597708463669,0,-0.06553195416927338,0,0,0.09829793870449066,0.016382988542318344,0,0,0,0,0.03276597708463669,0.08191494643688202,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06553195416927338,0,0,0,-0.008191494271159172,0,0.09829793870449066,0.04095747321844101,0,-0.06553195416927338,0,0,0,0.04095747321844101,0,0,-0.016382988542318344,0,0.03276597708463669,0.08191494643688202,0,-0.03276597708463669,-0.008191494271159172,0,0,0.008191494271159172,0,-0.16382989287376404,-0.016382988542318344,0,0,0.04914896935224533,0,-0.03276597708463669,-0.008191494271159172,0],"text":"<!-- Source: external/retro-commodore.eu/files/development/c64-development/Butterfield_Machine_Language_for_the_Commodore_64_and_other_Commodore_Computers.ocr.txt#MACHINE-LANGUAGE-FOR-COMMODORE-MACHINES-2 -->\nNOTE: It was indicated that the 6525 will maintain Priority Interrupt information from previously serviced interrupts.\nThis is achieved by the use of an Interrupt Stack. This stack is pushed whenever a read of AIR occurs and is pulled whenever a write to AIR occurs. It is therefore important not to perform any extraneous reads or writes to AIR since this will cause extra and unwanted stack operations to occur.\nThe only time a read of AIR should occur is to respond to an interrupt request.\nThe only time a write of AIR should occur is to signal the 6525 that the interrupt service is complete.","sourcePath":"external/retro-commodore.eu/files/development/c64-development/Butterfield_Machine_Language_for_the_Commodore_64_and_other_Commodore_Computers.ocr.txt","sourceMtimeMs":1761327713592,"origin":"external/retro-commodore.eu/files/development/c64-development/Butterfield_Machine_Language_for_the_Commodore_64_and_other_Commodore_Computers.ocr.txt#MACHINE-LANGUAGE-FOR-COMMODORE-MACHINES-2"},{"name":"retro-commodore.eu/files/development/c64-development/Butterfield_Machine_Language_for_the_Commodore_64_and_other_Commodore_Computers.ocr.txt","language":"hardware","vector":[0.04973743483424187,0.006217179354280233,0,0,-0.043520256876945496,0,0,0.024868717417120934,0,-0.024868717417120934,-0.024868717417120934,0,0.07460615038871765,0.012434358708560467,0,-0.04973743483424187,-0.031085897237062454,0,0.024868717417120934,0.012434358708560467,0,0,0,0,0,0.04973743483424187,0,-0.07460615038871765,-0.018651537597179413,0,0.024868717417120934,0.06838896870613098,0,0,-0.031085897237062454,0,0.04973743483424187,0.012434358708560467,0,0,0,0,0.09947486966848373,0.012434358708560467,0,-0.07460615038871765,-0.031085897237062454,0,0.024868717417120934,0.006217179354280233,0,-0.07460615038871765,-0.06217179447412491,0,0.04973743483424187,0.037303075194358826,0,0,0,0,0.04973743483424187,0,0,0,-0.043520256876945496,0,0,0.018651537597179413,0,0,-0.05595461279153824,0,0,0.006217179354280233,0,-0.024868717417120934,-0.018651537597179413,0,0,0,0,-0.12434358894824982,-0.012434358708560467,0,0,0.006217179354280233,0,-0.19894973933696747,-0.1492123007774353,0,0.04973743483424187,0,0,-0.024868717417120934,-0.037303075194358826,0,0.024868717417120934,0.024868717417120934,0,0,-0.006217179354280233,0,0.2984246015548706,0,0,-0.04973743483424187,-0.037303075194358826,0,0,0.04973743483424187,0,-0.024868717417120934,-0.031085897237062454,0,0.04973743483424187,0.012434358708560467,0,-0.024868717417120934,-0.012434358708560467,0,0.07460615038871765,0.006217179354280233,0,0,-0.043520256876945496,0,0.24868717789649963,0.012434358708560467,0,-0.19894973933696747,-0.006217179354280233,0,0.19894973933696747,0.031085897237062454,0,0,0,0,0.024868717417120934,0.06217179447412491,0,0,-0.037303075194358826,0,0.04973743483424187,0.031085897237062454,0,-0.07460615038871765,-0.04973743483424187,0,0.22381845116615295,0.031085897237062454,0,-0.024868717417120934,0,0,0,0.031085897237062454,0,-0.17408102750778198,-0.006217179354280233,0,0,0,0,-0.024868717417120934,-0.006217179354280233,0,0,0.006217179354280233,0,-0.04973743483424187,-0.012434358708560467,0,0.024868717417120934,0,0,-0.07460615038871765,-0.06217179447412491,0,0.04973743483424187,0.006217179354280233,0,-0.04973743483424187,-0.12434358894824982,0,0.04973743483424187,0.024868717417120934,0,-0.07460615038871765,-0.018651537597179413,0,0,0.012434358708560467,0,0,-0.006217179354280233,0,0.09947486966848373,0.1492123007774353,0,-0.07460615038871765,-0.09947486966848373,0,0.12434358894824982,0,0,-0.024868717417120934,-0.031085897237062454,0,0,0.037303075194358826,0,0,-0.012434358708560467,0,0,0.037303075194358826,0,-0.07460615038871765,-0.006217179354280233,0,0.024868717417120934,0.14299511909484863,0,-0.19894973933696747,-0.11190922558307648,0,0.09947486966848373,0.1056920513510704,0,0,0,0,0,0.012434358708560467,0,-0.17408102750778198,-0.018651537597179413,0,0.024868717417120934,0.031085897237062454,0,-0.024868717417120934,-0.037303075194358826,0,0.024868717417120934,0.12434358894824982,0,-0.024868717417120934,-0.012434358708560467,0,0,0.024868717417120934,0,0,-0.1056920513510704,0,0.024868717417120934,0.006217179354280233,0,0,-0.031085897237062454,0,0,0.012434358708560467,0,0,-0.024868717417120934,0,0,0.024868717417120934,0,-0.024868717417120934,-0.037303075194358826,0,0,0.024868717417120934,0,-0.09947486966848373,-0.024868717417120934,0,0.04973743483424187,0.024868717417120934,0,-0.024868717417120934,-0.043520256876945496,0,0,0,0,-0.04973743483424187,-0.031085897237062454,0,0.024868717417120934,0.04973743483424187,0,-0.024868717417120934,-0.08704051375389099,0,0,0.07460615038871765,0,-0.024868717417120934,-0.018651537597179413,0,0.024868717417120934,0.006217179354280233,0,0,0,0,0.04973743483424187,0.07460615038871765,0,0,-0.04973743483424187,0,0.07460615038871765,0.012434358708560467,0,-0.04973743483424187,-0.1056920513510704,0,0.024868717417120934,0.06217179447412491,0,0,-0.006217179354280233,0,0.024868717417120934,0.018651537597179413,0,-0.024868717417120934,-0.08704051375389099,0,0,0.07460615038871765,0,-0.024868717417120934,-0.06217179447412491,0,0.024868717417120934,0.06217179447412491,0,0,-0.012434358708560467,0,0,0.006217179354280233,0,0,0,0,0.024868717417120934,0.024868717417120934,0,-0.09947486966848373,-0.018651537597179413,0,0,0.05595461279153824,0,-0.024868717417120934,-0.006217179354280233,0,0,0,0,-0.024868717417120934,-0.05595461279153824,0,0,0,0,-0.2984246015548706,-0.05595461279153824,0,0,0.024868717417120934,0,-0.07460615038871765,-0.024868717417120934,0],"text":"<!--

Pieces are fitted into a selected rectangular shape \"visibly\"-- in other words, they may be seen on the screen as they are tried.\nThe machine language programs follow the logic of the BASIC program precisely. The \" shape tables\" have been rearranged for greater machine language convenience (each piece is reached by indexing; the index range of  to 5 5 5 dictates the piece being selected and its rotation).\nThe machine language program uses no indirect addressing and no sub routines. That is not necessarily good practice; it is largely a result of writing the program logic to exactly match the BASIC program.","sourcePath":"external/retro-commodore.eu/files/development/c64-development/Butterfield_Machine_Language_for_the_Commodore_64_and_other_Commodore_Computers.ocr.txt","sourceMtimeMs":1761327713592,"origin":"external/retro-commodore.eu/files/development/c64-development/Butterfield_Machine_Language_for_the_Commodore_64_and_other_Commodore_Computers.ocr.txt#APPENDIX-J-2"},{"name":"retro-commodore.eu/files/development/c64-development/Butterfield_Machine_Language_for_the_Commodore_64_and_other_Commodore_Computers.ocr.txt","language":"hardware","vector":[0.025227557867765427,0.025227557867765427,0,0,-0.03153444454073906,0,0.07568266987800598,0.03153444454073906,0,-0.012613778933882713,-0.012613778933882713,0,0.03784133493900299,0.025227557867765427,0,-0.1009102314710617,-0.012613778933882713,0,0.29011690616607666,0.025227557867765427,0,-0.025227557867765427,-0.0031534447334706783,0,0.025227557867765427,0.018920667469501495,0,0,-0.006306889466941357,0,0.03784133493900299,0.06937578320503235,0,0,-0.02207411266863346,0,0.05045511573553085,0.012613778933882713,0,-0.03784133493900299,-0.018920667469501495,0,0.05045511573553085,0.028381001204252243,0,-0.012613778933882713,-0.056762002408504486,0,0,0.05360855907201767,0,-0.07568266987800598,-0.009460333734750748,0,0.1765929013490677,0.01576722227036953,0,-0.03784133493900299,-0.05360855907201767,0,0.03784133493900299,0.028381001204252243,0,-0.012613778933882713,-0.025227557867765427,0,0.05045511573553085,0.056762002408504486,0,-0.025227557867765427,-0.012613778933882713,0,0.012613778933882713,0,0,0,-0.05360855907201767,0,0.06306888908147812,0.04414822533726692,0,-0.07568266987800598,-0.01576722227036953,0,0.012613778933882713,0,0,-0.3027306795120239,-0.10721711814403534,0,0.012613778933882713,0.01576722227036953,0,-0.012613778933882713,-0.025227557867765427,0,0,0.025227557867765427,0,-0.03784133493900299,-0.018920667469501495,0,0.1387515664100647,0.04099477827548981,0,-0.12613777816295624,-0.012613778933882713,0,0.025227557867765427,0.018920667469501495,0,-0.03784133493900299,-0.05360855907201767,0,0.06306888908147812,0.15136533975601196,0,0,-0.01576722227036953,0,0.012613778933882713,0.02207411266863346,0,0,-0.006306889466941357,0,0.3784133493900299,0.025227557867765427,0,-0.2396617978811264,0,0,0.025227557867765427,0.034687891602516174,0,0,-0.018920667469501495,0,0.012613778933882713,0.03153444454073906,0,0,-0.006306889466941357,0,0.025227557867765427,0.018920667469501495,0,-0.025227557867765427,-0.04414822533726692,0,0.07568266987800598,0.09460333734750748,0,-0.012613778933882713,-0.025227557867765427,0,0.025227557867765427,0.03153444454073906,0,-0.025227557867765427,-0.025227557867765427,0,0.025227557867765427,0.034687891602516174,0,0,-0.01576722227036953,0,0,0.009460333734750748,0,0,-0.02207411266863346,0,0.05045511573553085,0.04099477827548981,0,-0.1009102314710617,-0.05045511573553085,0,0.05045511573553085,0.018920667469501495,0,0,-0.15136533975601196,0,0.05045511573553085,0.006306889466941357,0,-0.05045511573553085,-0.02207411266863346,0,0.025227557867765427,0.018920667469501495,0,-0.012613778933882713,-0.025227557867765427,0,0.025227557867765427,0.06937578320503235,0,-0.025227557867765427,-0.11352400481700897,0,0.12613777816295624,0.018920667469501495,0,-0.03784133493900299,-0.028381001204252243,0,0,0.03784133493900299,0,-0.025227557867765427,0,0,0.012613778933882713,0.025227557867765427,0,-0.07568266987800598,-0.0031534447334706783,0,0.1387515664100647,0.1986670047044754,0,-0.012613778933882713,-0.14505845308303833,0,0.03784133493900299,0.08514300733804703,0,-0.03784133493900299,-0.006306889466941357,0,0.03784133493900299,0.012613778933882713,0,0,0,0,0.12613777816295624,0.02207411266863346,0,-0.05045511573553085,-0.012613778933882713,0,0,0.05045511573553085,0,-0.08829645067453384,-0.01576722227036953,0,0.025227557867765427,0.025227557867765427,0,-0.012613778933882713,-0.01576722227036953,0,0,0.012613778933882713,0,-0.025227557867765427,-0.018920667469501495,0,0.012613778933882713,0.04414822533726692,0,-0.025227557867765427,-0.009460333734750748,0,0.05045511573553085,0.034687891602516174,0,-0.07568266987800598,-0.05360855907201767,0,0.012613778933882713,0.03784133493900299,0,-0.025227557867765427,-0.006306889466941357,0,0,0.028381001204252243,0,-0.012613778933882713,-0.025227557867765427,0,0.025227557867765427,0.028381001204252243,0,-0.012613778933882713,-0.025227557867765427,0,0.03784133493900299,0.01576722227036953,0,-0.025227557867765427,-0.08829645067453384,0,0.025227557867765427,0.06622233986854553,0,0,-0.02207411266863346,0,0.03784133493900299,0,0,0,-0.02207411266863346,0,0.025227557867765427,0.04099477827548981,0,0,-0.06937578320503235,0,0.07568266987800598,0.07568266987800598,0,-0.025227557867765427,-0.01576722227036953,0,0.025227557867765427,0.034687891602516174,0,-0.025227557867765427,-0.018920667469501495,0,0.05045511573553085,0.02207411266863346,0,-0.07568266987800598,0,0,0.03784133493900299,0.1576722264289856,0,-0.012613778933882713,-0.0851

within a processor where information can be held temporarily.\nScreen editing: (1) The ability to change the screen of a computer and cause a corresponding change in memory.\nScreen memory: (2) The part of a computer holding the information displayed on the screen. Changing screen memory will change the screen; reading screen memory will reveal what is on the screen.\nSelected: (1) A chip or device that has been signaled to participate in a data transfer. If the chip or device has not been selected, it will ignore data operations.\nSelf-modifying: (7) A type of program that changes itself as it runs. Rare, and not always considered good programming practice.\nSigned number: (3) A number that holds a value that may be either positive or negative.\nSource code: (1) Instructions written in assembly language; usually, the first code written by the programmer before performing an assembly.\nStack: (7) A temporary, or \"scratch pad,\" set of memory locations. Status register, processor status word: (3) Within the processor, a register that holds status flags. Store: (1) To transfer information from the processor to memory. The store operation is a copying activity: the information still remains in the processor. Subroutine: (2) A set of instructions that can be called up by another program. Symbolic address, label: (7) A name identifying a memory location. Symbolic assembler: (2) An assembler in which symbolic addresses may be used. This is more powerful than a non-symbolic assembler. Testable flag: (3) A flag that can be tested by means of a conditional branch instruction. Two's complement: (3) A method of representing negative numbers.

Commodore 64 Keycodes\n\nIndex (By Memory Location)\n\n::::::::::::\n::Foreword::\n::::::::::::\n\nThis is a memory map of the Commodore 64 personal computer.  But it's\nmuch more than that.  It's a reference book which every programmer who\nuses the 64 will find invaluable.  What is a memory map?  It's a list\nof the memory locations in a computer.  But Mapping the Commodore 64\nis a memory amp that goes much further.  It explains the purpose of\neach location and shows you how to change the contents of many of\nthem.  You can make the computer do what you want it to.  If you're a\nBASIC programmer, you'll find easy-to-understand explanations of how\nto use the advanced features of the Commodore 64, and how to include\nthese features in your own programs.  If you're already using machine\nlanguage to write your own programs, you'll use this guide over and\nover again, referring to specific memory locations and routines.\nYou'll have the most complete guide to the Commodore 64's memory\navailable.\n\nAs with all COMPUTE! books, the explanations are clear and easy to\nunderstand.  Beginning and advanced programmers alike will find\nMapping the Commodore 64 a valuable resource.\n\n::::::::::::::::::::\n::Acknowledgements::\n::::::::::::::::::::\n\nI would like to thank Russ Davies, author of Mapping the VIC, for his\ngenerosity in sharing the results of his research.  Without his help,\nand that of Dan Heeb, author of the The Commodore 64 and VIC Tool Kit,\nthis book would have been much less complete.","sourcePath":"external/zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/c64/manuals/mapping-c64.txt","sourceMtimeMs":1761327822859,"origin":"external/zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/c64/manuals/mapping-c64.txt#Appendix-H-Commodore-64-Keycodes"},{"name":"zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/c64/manuals/mapping-c64.txt","language":"hardware","vector":[0,0,0,0,-0.056881438940763474,0,0.06500735878944397,0.036566637456417084,0,-0.016251839697360992,-0.02031479962170124,0,0.11376287788152695,0,0,-0.06500735878944397,-0.04062959924340248,0,0.032503679394721985,0.02437775954604149,0,0,0,0,0.032503679394721985,0.016251839697360992,0,-0.08125919848680496,-0.012188879773020744,0,0.032503679394721985,0.052818477153778076,0,-0.032503679394721985,-0.04062959924340248,0,0.016251839697360992,0.012188879773020744,0,-0.016251839697360992,-0.032503679394721985,0,0.032503679394721985,0.04469255730509758,0,-0.016251839697360992,-0.028440719470381737,0,0.016251839697360992,0,0,-0.032503679394721985,-0.008125919848680496,0,0.11376287788152695,0,0,0,-0.004062959924340248,0,0.016251839697360992,0.02437775954604149,0,-0.04875551909208298,-0.016251839697360992,0,0.016251839697360992,0.008125919848680496,0,-0.016251839697360992,-0.02437775954604149,0,0,0,0,0,-0.008125919848680496,0,0.032503679394721985,0.06094439700245857,0,-0.09751103818416595,-0.028440719470381737,0,0.04875551909208298,0.004062959924340248,0,-0.06500735878944397,-0.2193998396396637,0,0,0.012188879773020744,0,-0.032503679394721985,-0.06500735878944397,0,0.032503679394721985,0.004062959924340248,0,-0.17877022922039032,-0.008125919848680496,0,0.32503679394721985,0.04062959924340248,0,-0.08125919848680496,-0.008125919848680496,0,0.06500735878944397,0.056881438940763474,0,0,-0.036566637456417084,0,0.032503679394721985,0.016251839697360992,0,-0.04875551909208298,-0.004062959924340248,0,0.09751103818416595,0.02437775954604149,0,-0.016251839697360992,-0.04469255730509758,0,0.2437775880098343,0.016251839697360992,0,-0.04875551909208298,-0.02437775954604149,0,0.16251839697360992,0.02031479962170124,0,-0.016251839697360992,-0.008125919848680496,0,0,0.02437775954604149,0,-0.08125919848680496,-0.012188879773020744,0,0.016251839697360992,0.008125919848680496,0,-0.016251839697360992,-0.028440719470381737,0,0.13001471757888794,0.06094439700245857,0,-0.06500735878944397,-0.012188879773020744,0,0,0.02031479962170124,0,-0.032503679394721985,-0.02437775954604149,0,0.016251839697360992,0.008125919848680496,0,-0.016251839697360992,-0.008125919848680496,0,0,0,0,-0.016251839697360992,0,0,0,0.02437775954604149,0,-0.1950220763683319,-0.052818477153778076,0,0.08125919848680496,0.02437775954604149,0,-0.04875551909208298,-0.04062959924340248,0,0,0,0,-0.09751103818416595,-0.016251839697360992,0,0,0.04062959924340248,0,0,-0.09751103818416595,0,0,0.16251839697360992,0,-0.016251839697360992,-0.14626654982566833,0,0.2112739086151123,0.032503679394721985,0,-0.06500735878944397,-0.028440719470381737,0,0.016251839697360992,0.016251839697360992,0,-0.032503679394721985,-0.02437775954604149,0,0.08125919848680496,0.06500735878944397,0,-0.11376287788152695,-0.012188879773020744,0,0,0.15032951533794403,0,-0.032503679394721985,-0.04062959924340248,0,0,0.08938511461019516,0,-0.016251839697360992,-0.008125919848680496,0,0.032503679394721985,0.008125919848680496,0,-0.032503679394721985,-0.06094439700245857,0,0.032503679394721985,0.016251839697360992,0,-0.032503679394721985,-0.016251839697360992,0,0,0.06907031685113907,0,-0.032503679394721985,-0.036566637456417084,0,0.04875551909208298,0.008125919848680496,0,-0.04875551909208298,-0.02031479962170124,0,0.016251839697360992,0.012188879773020744,0,-0.032503679394721985,-0.016251839697360992,0,0.04875551909208298,0.028440719470381737,0,-0.032503679394721985,-0.008125919848680496,0,0.016251839697360992,0.004062959924340248,0,-0.032503679394721985,-0.10969991981983185,0,0.032503679394721985,0.04469255730509758,0,0,-0.028440719470381737,0,0,0,0,-0.016251839697360992,-0.04875551909208298,0,0,0.008125919848680496,0,-0.016251839697360992,-0.02437775954604149,0,0.032503679394721985,0.012188879773020744,0,-0.016251839697360992,-0.02437775954604149,0,0,0.10563695430755615,0,-0.032503679394721985,-0.04062959924340248,0,0.04875551909208298,0.016251839697360992,0,0,-0.06094439700245857,0,0.032503679394721985,0.12188879400491714,0,-0.016251839697360992,-0.07719624042510986,0,0,0.016251839697360992,0,-0.04875551909208298,-0.016251839697360992,0,0.016251839697360992,0.008125919848680496,0,-0.04875551909208298,-0.02031479962170124,0,0.04875551909208298,0.04062959924340248,0,0,-0.02031479962170124,0,0,0.07719624042510986,0,0,-0.028440719470381737,0,0,0.04062959924340248,0,0,-0.02031479962170124,0,0.032503679394721985,0.02437775954604149,0,-0.016251839697360992,-0.04469255730509758,0,0,0.012188879773020744,0,-0.032503679394721985,-0.02031479962170124,0,0,0.056881438940763474,0,0,-0.032503679394721985,0,0.09751103818416595,0.008125919848680496,0,-0.032503679394721985,-0.02437775954604149,0,0,0.0203147996217

the computer so that it will let them play games,\nor do word processing, or keep financial records.  But this type of\napplications software is by no means the only kind.\n\nIt is important to remember that a computer cannot do anything without\nsome kind of program.  When the computer displays the READY prompt, or\nblinks the cursor, or displays the letters that you type, it can only\ndo so by executing a program.  In the examples shown above, it is the\nmaster control program, the Operating System (OS), which is being\nexecuted.\n\nWhen you give the computer a command such as LOAD, the BASIC\ninterpreter program translates the English-like request to the\nlanguage of numbers which the computer understands.  The Operating\nSystem and BASIC interpreter programs are contained in permanent Read\nOnly Memory (ROM), and are available as soon as you turn the power on.\nWithout them, your computer would be a rather expensive paperweight.\n\nThis permanent software co-exists inside your computer with the\napplications program that you load.  Since the system software\nperforms many of the same functions as the applications program (such\nas reading information from the keyboard and displaying it on the\nscreen), it is often possible for the applications program to make use\nof certain parts of the Operating System.  This not only makes the\ntask of the programmer easier, but in come cases it allows him or her\nto do things that otherwise would not be possible.","sourcePath":"external/zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/c64/manuals/mapping-c64.txt","sourceMtimeMs":1761327822859,"origin":"external/zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/c64/manuals/mapping-c64.txt#Appendix-H-Commodore-64-Keycodes-3"},{"name":"zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/c64/manuals/mapping-c64.txt","language":"hardware","vector":[0,0.032343633472919464,0,0,-0.08085907995700836,0,0.032343633472919464,0.03638658672571182,0,0,-0.03638658672571182,0,0.032343633472919464,0.02021476998925209,0,-0.016171816736459732,-0.06468726694583893,0,0.048515450209379196,0.04447249695658684,0,-0.048515450209379196,-0.016171816736459732,0,0.032343633472919464,0,0,0,-0.008085908368229866,0,0.016171816736459732,0.08490203320980072,0,-0.016171816736459732,-0.02021476998925209,0,0,0.008085908368229866,0,-0.016171816736459732,-0.032343633472919464,0,0.12937453389167786,0.032343633472919464,0,0,-0.03638658672571182,0,0.08085907995700836,0.02021476998925209,0,-0.06468726694583893,-0.012128862552344799,0,0.17788998782634735,0.016171816736459732,0,-0.032343633472919464,-0.024257725104689598,0,0,0.02021476998925209,0,-0.06468726694583893,-0.024257725104689598,0,0.11320271342992783,0.024257725104689598,0,-0.048515450209379196,-0.008085908368229866,0,0.016171816736459732,0.024257725104689598,0,0,-0.028300678357481956,0,0.032343633472919464,0.032343633472919464,0,-0.1455463469028473,0,0,0.032343633472919464,0.028300678357481956,0,-0.1455463469028473,-0.11320271342992783,0,0.032343633472919464,0.024257725104689598,0,-0.016171816736459732,-0.028300678357481956,0,0.032343633472919464,0,0,-0.09703090041875839,-0.012128862552344799,0,0.19406180083751678,0.02021476998925209,0,-0.032343633472919464,-0.012128862552344799,0,0.032343633472919464,0.02021476998925209,0,0,-0.012128862552344799,0,0.048515450209379196,0.04042953997850418,0,-0.032343633472919464,-0.04042953997850418,0,0.06468726694583893,0.028300678357481956,0,0,-0.012128862552344799,0,0.3396081328392029,0.016171816736459732,0,-0.032343633472919464,-0.012128862552344799,0,0.06468726694583893,0.016171816736459732,0,-0.08085907995700836,-0.012128862552344799,0,0.08085907995700836,0.06468726694583893,0,-0.06468726694583893,-0.004042954184114933,0,0.032343633472919464,0.04042953997850418,0,-0.032343633472919464,-0.032343633472919464,0,0.1455463469028473,0.09298794716596603,0,-0.048515450209379196,-0.032343633472919464,0,0,0.012128862552344799,0,-0.016171816736459732,-0.03638658672571182,0,0,0.05660135671496391,0,-0.032343633472919464,-0.024257725104689598,0,0,0.008085908368229866,0,-0.016171816736459732,-0.012128862552344799,0,0,0.024257725104689598,0,-0.19406180083751678,-0.08490203320980072,0,0.048515450209379196,0.02021476998925209,0,-0.048515450209379196,-0.076816126704216,0,0.016171816736459732,0.024257725104689598,0,-0.22640542685985565,-0.016171816736459732,0,0.048515450209379196,0.028300678357481956,0,-0.032343633472919464,-0.048515450209379196,0,0,0.09703090041875839,0,0,-0.06873022019863129,0,0.3396081328392029,0.024257725104689598,0,-0.08085907995700836,-0.004042954184114933,0,0,0.024257725104689598,0,0,-0.016171816736459732,0,0.032343633472919464,0.04042953997850418,0,-0.11320271342992783,0,0,0.08085907995700836,0.17788998782634735,0,-0.048515450209379196,-0.02021476998925209,0,0.06468726694583893,0.04447249695658684,0,0,-0.052558403462171555,0,0.016171816736459732,0.048515450209379196,0,0,-0.032343633472919464,0,0.06468726694583893,0.02021476998925209,0,0,-0.02021476998925209,0,0.032343633472919464,0.07277317345142365,0,-0.048515450209379196,-0.028300678357481956,0,0.032343633472919464,0.032343633472919464,0,0,-0.008085908368229866,0,0.11320271342992783,0.02021476998925209,0,-0.032343633472919464,-0.032343633472919464,0,0.032343633472919464,0.04447249695658684,0,-0.08085907995700836,-0.016171816736459732,0,0,0,0,-0.048515450209379196,-0.11320271342992783,0,0.016171816736459732,0.052558403462171555,0,-0.048515450209379196,-0.03638658672571182,0,0.016171816736459732,0.012128862552344799,0,-0.016171816736459732,-0.11320271342992783,0,0.06468726694583893,0.032343633472919464,0,-0.06468726694583893,-0.052558403462171555,0,0.048515450209379196,0.008085908368229866,0,-0.048515450209379196,-0.03638658672571182,0,0.032343633472919464,0.17788998782634735,0,-0.016171816736459732,-0.04447249695658684,0,0.06468726694583893,0.008085908368229866,0,-0.016171816736459732,-0.024257725104689598,0,0,0.06468726694583893,0,-0.016171816736459732,-0.06468726694583893,0,0,0.048515450209379196,0,0,-0.024257725104689598,0,0.016171816736459732,0.04447249695658684,0,-0.06468726694583893,-0.008085908368229866,0,0.048515450209379196,0.024257725104689598,0,-0.016171816736459732,0,0,0,0.11724566668272018,0,0,-0.008085908368229866,0,0,0.032343633472919464,0,-0.048515450209379196,-0.04447249695658684,0,0.032343633472919464,0.03638658672571182,0,-0.048515450209379196,-0.016171816736459732,0,0.016171816736459732,0.06468726694583893,0,-0.016171816736459732,-0.024257725104689598,0,0.032343633472919464,0.052558403462171

Source: external/zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/c64/manuals/mapping-c64.txt#Appendix-H-Commodore-64-Keycodes-4 -->\nThe Commodore 64 also has hardware support chips which enable the\ngraphics display, sound synthesis, and communications with external\ndevices.  Since these chips are addressed like memory, they occupy\nspace in our map.  Control over these chips, and the graphics, sound,\nand I/O functions they make possible, can only be accomplished by\nmanipulation of the memory addresses which correspond to these\ndevices.  Therefore, a guide to these addresses is necessary in order\nto take advantage of the graphics, music, and communications power\nthat they offer.\n\nThe purpose of this book is to describe the memory locations used by\nthe system, and to show, wherever possible, how to utilize them in\nyour own programs.  The book should clear up some of the mystery\nsurrounding the way your computer works.\n\nHow to Use This Book\n\nThe Commodore 64 and communicate with 64K or 65536 (64*1024) bytes of\nmemory.  Each of these bytes of memory can store a number from 0 to\n255.  The computer can read (and sometimes write) information from any\nof these 65536 locations by using its address, a number from 0 to\n65535.\n\nBits and Bytes\n\nEach byte is make up of eight binary digits called bits.  These bits\nare the computer's smallest unit of information.  They can contain\nonly the number one or the number zero, but when combined, they can be\nused to form any number needed.  To see how that is possible, let's\nlook at a single bit.\n\nA single bit can only be a one or a zero.  But if two bits are\ncombined the number increases.\n\n00,01,10,11\n\nThat makes four possible combinations.

a large body of software to be translated for the 64 with\nlittle change (in most cases, the PET Emulator program from Commodore\nwill allow you to run PET programs with no changes).  Programming aids\nand tricks developed for the PET and VIC will, for the most part,\ncarry over quite nicely to the 64.  Although there is no official\nsource code listing of the ROM available from Commodore, this version\nof BASIC has been around long enough that it has been thoroughly\ndisassembled, dissected, and documented by PET users.\n\nThe labels used here correspond to those used by Jim Butterfield in\nhis PET memory maps, which are well-known among PET BASIC users.  They\nshould, therefore, provide some assistance in locating equivalent\nroutines on the two machines.  A good description of the workings of\nPET BASIC can be found in Programming the PET/CBM by Raeto West.\n\nIt is beyond the scope of this book to detail the inner workings of\neach routine in the BASIC interpreter.  However, the following summary\nof routines and their functions should aid the user who is interested\nin calling BASIC routines from his or her own program, or in modifying\nthe BASIC.","sourcePath":"external/zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/c64/manuals/mapping-c64.txt","sourceMtimeMs":1761327822859,"origin":"external/zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/c64/manuals/mapping-c64.txt#FOR-I0-TO-255POKE-1024IIPOKE-102454272I1NEXT-7"},{"name":"zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/c64/manuals/mapping-c64.txt","language":"hardware","vector":[0.021765826269984245,0,0,-0.04353165253996849,-0.04897310957312584,0,0.08706330507993698,0.03264874219894409,0,-0.04353165253996849,-0.03264874219894409,0,0.13059496879577637,0.005441456567496061,0,-0.04353165253996849,-0.04897310957312584,0,0.06529748439788818,0,0,0,-0.021765826269984245,0,0.04353165253996849,0.021765826269984245,0,-0.021765826269984245,-0.010882913134992123,0,0,0.03264874219894409,0,-0.04353165253996849,-0.03264874219894409,0,0.021765826269984245,0.010882913134992123,0,0,-0.027207283303141594,0,0.021765826269984245,0.03264874219894409,0,-0.021765826269984245,-0.04353165253996849,0,0.021765826269984245,0,0,-0.04353165253996849,-0.021765826269984245,0,0.06529748439788818,0.021765826269984245,0,-0.13059496879577637,-0.016324371099472046,0,0,0.027207283303141594,0,0,-0.03809019550681114,0,0.04353165253996849,0.010882913134992123,0,0,-0.010882913134992123,0,0.021765826269984245,0.016324371099472046,0,0,-0.027207283303141594,0,0.021765826269984245,0.005441456567496061,0,-0.15236078202724457,-0.027207283303141594,0,0,0.04353165253996849,0,-0.06529748439788818,-0.13603641092777252,0,0.06529748439788818,0.05441456660628319,0,-0.06529748439788818,-0.03809019550681114,0,0.021765826269984245,0.021765826269984245,0,-0.021765826269984245,-0.04353165253996849,0,0.3917848765850067,0.059856023639440536,0,-0.17412661015987396,-0.021765826269984245,0,0.04353165253996849,0.06529748439788818,0,0,-0.021765826269984245,0,0.021765826269984245,0.03264874219894409,0,-0.04353165253996849,-0.005441456567496061,0,0.021765826269984245,0.027207283303141594,0,0,-0.016324371099472046,0,0.28295573592185974,0,0,-0.021765826269984245,-0.021765826269984245,0,0.04353165253996849,0.010882913134992123,0,0,-0.010882913134992123,0,0.021765826269984245,0.016324371099472046,0,-0.021765826269984245,-0.016324371099472046,0,0.021765826269984245,0.010882913134992123,0,-0.04353165253996849,-0.03264874219894409,0,0.17412661015987396,0.03809019550681114,0,-0.021765826269984245,-0.07618039101362228,0,0,0.016324371099472046,0,-0.13059496879577637,-0.005441456567496061,0,0.06529748439788818,0.021765826269984245,0,-0.04353165253996849,-0.005441456567496061,0,0,0.021765826269984245,0,-0.08706330507993698,-0.005441456567496061,0,0,0.016324371099472046,0,-0.15236078202724457,-0.08162184804677963,0,0.08706330507993698,0,0,-0.08706330507993698,-0.03264874219894409,0,0.021765826269984245,0.03809019550681114,0,-0.19589243829250336,-0.04353165253996849,0,0,0.010882913134992123,0,0,-0.021765826269984245,0,0.04353165253996849,0.20677535235881805,0,0,-0.15236078202724457,0,0.13059496879577637,0.04353165253996849,0,-0.04353165253996849,-0.016324371099472046,0,0,0.016324371099472046,0,-0.021765826269984245,-0.03264874219894409,0,0,0.03264874219894409,0,-0.13059496879577637,-0.010882913134992123,0,0,0.17412661015987396,0,-0.04353165253996849,-0.021765826269984245,0,0,0.03809019550681114,0,-0.021765826269984245,0,0,0.06529748439788818,0.021765826269984245,0,-0.10882913321256638,-0.016324371099472046,0,0.04353165253996849,0.010882913134992123,0,-0.04353165253996849,-0.03264874219894409,0,0.021765826269984245,0.09250476211309433,0,-0.021765826269984245,-0.010882913134992123,0,0.021765826269984245,0.005441456567496061,0,-0.021765826269984245,-0.07073893398046494,0,0.08706330507993698,0.03809019550681114,0,-0.021765826269984245,-0.03264874219894409,0,0.04353165253996849,0.016324371099472046,0,-0.021765826269984245,-0.07618039101362228,0,0.04353165253996849,0,0,-0.08706330507993698,-0.07618039101362228,0,0.06529748439788818,0.05441456660628319,0,0,-0.04353165253996849,0,0,0.016324371099472046,0,0,-0.09794621914625168,0,0,0.005441456567496061,0,-0.021765826269984245,-0.03809019550681114,0,0.021765826269984245,0.021765826269984245,0,-0.021765826269984245,-0.016324371099472046,0,0,0.08162184804677963,0,0,-0.03809019550681114,0,0,0.005441456567496061,0,-0.04353165253996849,-0.016324371099472046,0,0.021765826269984245,0.09794621914625168,0,-0.021765826269984245,-0.10882913321256638,0,0,0.010882913134992123,0,-0.04353165253996849,-0.021765826269984245,0,0.021765826269984245,0.005441456567496061,0,-0.04353165253996849,-0.021765826269984245,0,0.06529748439788818,0.03809019550681114,0,-0.021765826269984245,-0.05441456660628319,0,0,0.09250476211309433,0,-0.021765826269984245,-0.027207283303141594,0,0.04353165253996849,0.021765826269984245,0,-0.021765826269984245,-0.010882913134992123,0,0.021765826269984245,0.016324371099472046,0,-0.021765826269984245,-0.016324371099472046,0,0,0.04897310957312584,0,0,-0.021765826269984245,0,0.021765826269984245,0.06529748439788818,0,-0.04353165253996849,-0.016324371099472046,0,0,0.021765826269984245,0,-0.0

routines\nthat perform a particular function are to be used as guideposts, and\nnot absolutes.  In fact, BASIC enters many of these routines from\nslightly different places to accomplish different tasks.  Some\nsubroutines are called by so many commands that it is hard to say\nwhich they belong to.  You will even find that some whole commands are\npart of other commands.  Where it is important for you to know the\ndetails of a particular routine, you will need to obtain a disassembly\nof that section and look at the machine language program itself.\n\nIt should be noted that when BASIC is not neede,d it can be switched\nout and the RAM underneath can be accessed by the VIC-II chip and used\nfor screen graphics.  See location 56576 ($DD00) for more information.\n\n40960-40961   $A000-$A001\nCold Start Vector\n\nThis vector points to the address of the routine used to initialize\nBASIC.

entirely separate graphics system, whose\ncharacter shapes, colors, and positions are derived and displayed\nwithout any reference to the Video Matrix and Character Dot-Data\naddresses.  Best of all, these characters may be moved quickly and\neasily to any position on the screen, greatly facilitating games and\nanimated graphics of all types.  This system is known as sprite\ngraphics.\n\nSprite graphics takes its name from the graphics characters it\ndisplays, each of which is called a sprite.  There are eight sprites,\nknown as Sprites 0-7.  Each sprite character is 24 dots wide by 21\ndots high.

($D01C).  In this mode, as in multicolor\ntext and bitmap modes, pairs of bits are used to determine the color\nof each double- width dot.  The possible color values which may be\nselected are those of Background Color Register 0, the Sprite Color\nRegister, or the two color values in the Sprite Multicolor Registers\nat 53285-53286 ($D025-$D026).\n\nLocation Range: 53248-53264 ($D000-$D010)\nSprite Horizontal and Vertical Position Registers\n\nThese locations determine the horizontal and vertical position at\nwhich each sprite will be displayed on the screen.  Each sprite has\nits own horizontal and vertical position register.  In addition, all\nof the sprites share a common register which is used to extend the\nrange of horizontal positions.\n\nVertical positions for each sprite range from 0 to 255, and these\nindicate the vertical position of the top line of the sprite's 21-line\nlength.  Since there are only 200 visible scan lines in the screen\ndisplay, some of these vertical positions will result in the sprite\nbeing partially or wholly offscreen.","sourcePath":"external/zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/c64/manuals/mapping-c64.txt","sourceMtimeMs":1761327822859,"origin":"external/zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/c64/manuals/mapping-c64.txt#53248-57343-D000-DFFF-11"},{"name":"zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/c64/manuals/mapping-c64.txt","language":"hardware","vector":[0,0.011860301718115807,0,0,-0.03558090701699257,0,0.09488241374492645,0.05930151045322418,0,0,-0.03558090701699257,0,0.047441206872463226,0.023720603436231613,0,-0.047441206872463226,-0.03558090701699257,0,0.1897648274898529,0.023720603436231613,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.023720603436231613,0,0,0.0830221101641655,0,-0.047441206872463226,-0.03558090701699257,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.047441206872463226,0.023720603436231613,0,0,-0.011860301718115807,0,0,0,0,-0.047441206872463226,-0.011860301718115807,0,0.09488241374492645,0.023720603436231613,0,0,-0.023720603436231613,0,0,0.023720603436231613,0,0,0,0,0,0.023720603436231613,0,0,-0.011860301718115807,0,0.047441206872463226,0,0,0,-0.023720603436231613,0,0,0,0,-0.14232362806797028,0,0,0.047441206872463226,0.011860301718115807,0,-0.047441206872463226,-0.09488241374492645,0,0,0,0,-0.047441206872463226,-0.023720603436231613,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.42697086930274963,0.047441206872463226,0,-0.047441206872463226,0,0,0,0.023720603436231613,0,-0.047441206872463226,-0.023720603436231613,0,0.09488241374492645,0.09488241374492645,0,-0.09488241374492645,-0.011860301718115807,0,0,0.023720603436231613,0,-0.14232362806797028,-0.011860301718115807,0,0.23720604181289673,0.011860301718115807,0,0,-0.023720603436231613,0,0,0.011860301718115807,0,0,0,0,0,0.023720603436231613,0,0,-0.011860301718115807,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03558090701699257,0,0.3795296549797058,0.047441206872463226,0,0,0,0,0,0.011860301718115807,0,-0.09488241374492645,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.047441206872463226,0.03558090701699257,0,0,-0.011860301718115807,0,0.047441206872463226,0.011860301718115807,0,-0.047441206872463226,-0.07116181403398514,0,0.047441206872463226,0.03558090701699257,0,-0.047441206872463226,-0.023720603436231613,0,0,0,0,-0.14232362806797028,-0.03558090701699257,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.21348543465137482,0,0,-0.05930151045322418,0,0.332088440656662,0,0,-0.047441206872463226,-0.03558090701699257,0,0,0.047441206872463226,0,0,-0.047441206872463226,0,0,0.023720603436231613,0,-0.047441206872463226,-0.07116181403398514,0,0,0.13046331703662872,0,-0.047441206872463226,-0.011860301718115807,0,0,0.047441206872463226,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.047441206872463226,-0.011860301718115807,0,0,0.1897648274898529,0,0,0,0,0,0.011860301718115807,0,0,-0.047441206872463226,0,0.047441206872463226,0,0,-0.09488241374492645,-0.011860301718115807,0,0,0.047441206872463226,0,0,0,0,0,0.023720603436231613,0,0,-0.023720603436231613,0,0,0.023720603436231613,0,0,-0.023720603436231613,0,0,0.011860301718115807,0,0,-0.07116181403398514,0,0,0,0,-0.047441206872463226,-0.03558090701699257,0,0.09488241374492645,0.011860301718115807,0,-0.047441206872463226,-0.011860301718115807,0,0.047441206872463226,0.166044220328331,0,0,-0.03558090701699257,0,0.047441206872463226,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.10674271732568741,0,-0.047441206872463226,-0.03558090701699257,0,0,0,0,-0.047441206872463226,-0.03558090701699257,0,0,0.023720603436231613,0,0,-0.023720603436231613,0,0.047441206872463226,0,0,0,-0.03558090701699257,0,0,0.05930151045322418,0,0,-0.023720603436231613,0,0.047441206872463226,0,0,-0.047441206872463226,0,0,0.047441206872463226,0,0,0,0,0,0.047441206872463226,0.023720603436231613,0,0,-0.047441206872463226,0,0,0.09488241374492645,0,-0.047441206872463226,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.023720603436231613,0,0,0,0,-0.14232362806797028,0,0,0,0.011860301718115807,0,-0.047441206872463226,0,0],"text":"<!-- Source: external/zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/c64/manuals/mapping-c64.txt#POKE-532820POKE532832POKE532845 -->\nPOKE 53282,0:POKE53283,2:POKE53284,5\n\nThis sets the registers to black, red, and green, respectively.\nFinally, we will activate extended color mode by setting Bit 6 of the\nVIC-II register at location 53265 to a 1.

1\nanytime two sprites overlap, and Bit 1 is set to 1, when a sprite\nshape is touching the foreground text or bit-graphics display, these\nregisters specify which sprites were involved in the collision.  Every\nbit that is set to 1 indicates that the corresponding sprite was\ninvolved in the collision.  Reading these registers clears them so\nthat they can detect the next collision.  Therefore, if you plan to\nmake multiple tests on the values stored here, it may be necessary to\ncopy it to a RAM variable for further reference.\n\nNote that while these registers tell you what sprites were involved in\na collision, they do not necessarily tell you what objects have\ncollided with each other.  It is quite possible to have three sprites\nlined up in a row, where Sprite A is on the left, Sprite B is in the\nmiddle, touching Sprite A, and Sprite C is on the right, touching\nSprite B but not touching Sprite A.  The Sprite-Sprite Collision\nregister would show that all three are involved.  The only way to make\nabsolutely certain which collided with which is to check the position\nof each sprite, and calculate for each sprite display line if a sprite\nof that size would touch either of the others.  As you can imagine,\nthis is no easy task.","sourcePath":"external/zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/c64/manuals/mapping-c64.txt","sourceMtimeMs":1761327822859,"origin":"external/zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/c64/manuals/mapping-c64.txt#BINOT-X-AND-3POKE-BYPEEKBY-AND-NOT-3CABI-OR-COCABI-20"},{"name":"zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/c64/manuals/mapping-c64.txt","language":"hardware","vector":[0,0.01908043399453163,0,-0.025440577417612076,-0.03816086798906326,0,0.025440577417612076,0.057241301983594894,0,0,-0.03180072084069252,0,0.025440577417612076,0.006360144354403019,0,0,-0.025440577417612076,0,0.1017623096704483,0.03180072084069252,0,0,-0.006360144354403019,0,0.05088115483522415,0.012720288708806038,0,0,-0.012720288708806038,0,0.025440577417612076,0.04452101141214371,0,-0.05088115483522415,-0.006360144354403019,0,0.025440577417612076,0.012720288708806038,0,-0.05088115483522415,0,0,0.05088115483522415,0.025440577417612076,0,0,-0.025440577417612076,0,0.025440577417612076,0.025440577417612076,0,-0.025440577417612076,-0.012720288708806038,0,0.1017623096704483,0.006360144354403019,0,-0.025440577417612076,-0.04452101141214371,0,0.025440577417612076,0.06360144168138504,0,-0.05088115483522415,-0.01908043399453163,0,0.05088115483522415,0,0,0,-0.006360144354403019,0,0,0,0,0,-0.025440577417612076,0,0,0.025440577417612076,0,-0.05088115483522415,-0.006360144354403019,0,0.025440577417612076,0.01908043399453163,0,-0.12720288336277008,-0.11448260396718979,0,0.05088115483522415,0.08268187940120697,0,-0.025440577417612076,-0.012720288708806038,0,0.07632173597812653,0.006360144354403019,0,0,-0.05088115483522415,0,0.5342521667480469,0.01908043399453163,0,-0.05088115483522415,0,0,0.025440577417612076,0.01908043399453163,0,0,0,0,0.025440577417612076,0.057241301983594894,0,-0.05088115483522415,0,0,0.05088115483522415,0.05088115483522415,0,0,-0.012720288708806038,0,0.2798463702201843,0.012720288708806038,0,-0.07632173597812653,-0.025440577417612076,0,0,0.025440577417612076,0,-0.025440577417612076,-0.025440577417612076,0,0.05088115483522415,0.03180072084069252,0,0,-0.006360144354403019,0,0.025440577417612076,0.012720288708806038,0,-0.05088115483522415,-0.012720288708806038,0,0.17808404564857483,0.057241301983594894,0,0,-0.012720288708806038,0,0,0.025440577417612076,0,-0.05088115483522415,-0.03816086798906326,0,0.025440577417612076,0.03816086798906326,0,0,0,0,0.025440577417612076,0,0,-0.05088115483522415,-0.01908043399453163,0,0.025440577417612076,0.03180072084069252,0,-0.15264347195625305,-0.025440577417612076,0,0.025440577417612076,0.012720288708806038,0,-0.025440577417612076,-0.06360144168138504,0,0.025440577417612076,0.025440577417612076,0,-0.1017623096704483,-0.012720288708806038,0,0.025440577417612076,0.04452101141214371,0,-0.025440577417612076,0,0,0,0.26712608337402344,0,0,-0.07632173597812653,0,0.17808404564857483,0.05088115483522415,0,-0.025440577417612076,-0.006360144354403019,0,0,0.012720288708806038,0,0,-0.03180072084069252,0,0,0.03180072084069252,0,0,0,0,0,0.1462833285331726,0,-0.05088115483522415,-0.03816086798906326,0,0.025440577417612076,0.025440577417612076,0,-0.025440577417612076,-0.012720288708806038,0,0,0.03816086798906326,0,-0.07632173597812653,0,0,0,0.01908043399453163,0,-0.025440577417612076,-0.03816086798906326,0,0,0.09540216624736786,0,-0.1017623096704483,-0.012720288708806038,0,0.05088115483522415,0.012720288708806038,0,-0.025440577417612076,-0.025440577417612076,0,0.07632173597812653,0.01908043399453163,0,-0.05088115483522415,-0.006360144354403019,0,0.025440577417612076,0.03816086798906326,0,0,-0.03180072084069252,0,0.025440577417612076,0.01908043399453163,0,-0.15264347195625305,-0.08904202282428741,0,0.025440577417612076,0.025440577417612076,0,0,-0.012720288708806038,0,0.025440577417612076,0.012720288708806038,0,0,-0.05088115483522415,0,0.025440577417612076,0.012720288708806038,0,0,-0.025440577417612076,0,0.1017623096704483,0.006360144354403019,0,-0.05088115483522415,-0.03180072084069252,0,0,0.1017623096704483,0,0,-0.01908043399453163,0,0.05088115483522415,0.01908043399453163,0,0,0,0,0.025440577417612076,0.13356304168701172,0,-0.025440577417612076,-0.012720288708806038,0,0,0.006360144354403019,0,0,-0.025440577417612076,0,0.025440577417612076,0.01908043399453163,0,0,-0.025440577417612076,0,0.05088115483522415,0.012720288708806038,0,-0.05088115483522415,-0.03816086798906326,0,0.05088115483522415,0.06996159255504608,0,0,-0.03180072084069252,0,0,0,0,-0.07632173597812653,-0.057241301983594894,0,0.12720288336277008,0.03816086798906326,0,0,-0.012720288708806038,0,0,0.04452101141214371,0,0,-0.03816086798906326,0,0,0.057241301983594894,0,0,0,0,0.025440577417612076,0.012720288708806038,0,0,-0.08904202282428741,0,0,0.01908043399453163,0,-0.2035246193408966,0,0,0.15264347195625305,0.01908043399453163,0,-0.025440577417612076,-0.012720288708806038,0],"text":"<!--

one of these bits will result in a logical ANDing of\nthe waveforms.  Particularly, the combination of the noise waveform\nand another is not recommended.\n\nLocation Range: 54277-54278 ($D405-$D406)\nVoice 1 Envelop (ADSR) Control\n\nWhen a note is played on a musical instrument, the volume does not\nsuddenly rise to a peak and then cut off to zero.  Rather, the volume\nbuilds to a peak, levels off to an intermediate value, and then fades\naway.  This creates what is known as a volume envelope.\n\nThe first phase of the envelope, in which the volume builds to a peak,\nis known as the attack phase.  The second, in which it declines to an\nintermediate level, is called the decay phase.  The third, in which\nthe intermediate leve of volume is held, is known as the sustain\nperiod.  The final interval, in which the sound fades away, is called\nthe release part of the cycle.\n\nThe SID chip allows the volume envelope of each voice to be\ncontrolled, so that specific instruments may be imitated, or new\nsounds created.  This is done via the attack/decay and sustain/release\nregisters.  Each register devotes four bits (which can store a number\nfrom 0 to 15) to each phase of the cycle.  When a note is gated by\nwriting a 1 to a waveform bit and to Bit 0 of the Control Register,\nthe attack cycle begins.","sourcePath":"external/zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/c64/manuals/mapping-c64.txt","sourceMtimeMs":1761327822859,"origin":"external/zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/c64/manuals/mapping-c64.txt#PULSE-WIDTHREGISTER-VALUE4095-3"},{"name":"zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/c64/manuals/mapping-c64.txt","language":"hardware","vector":[0.015644945204257965,0.007822472602128983,0,0,-0.046934839338064194,0,0.12515956163406372,0.019556183367967606,0,-0.14080451428890228,-0.007822472602128983,0,0.046934839338064194,0.015644945204257965,0,-0.03128989040851593,-0.0860472023487091,0,0.015644945204257965,0,0,0,-0.019556183367967606,0,0,0.003911236301064491,0,-0.015644945204257965,-0.019556183367967606,0,0.03128989040851593,0.05866854637861252,0,-0.015644945204257965,-0.019556183367967606,0,0,0.015644945204257965,0,0,-0.003911236301064491,0,0.015644945204257965,0.05866854637861252,0,-0.046934839338064194,-0.03128989040851593,0,0.015644945204257965,0.015644945204257965,0,-0.046934839338064194,-0.05866854637861252,0,0.07822473347187042,0.019556183367967606,0,-0.046934839338064194,-0.023467419669032097,0,0,0.019556183367967606,0,0,-0.027378655970096588,0,0.06257978081703186,0.011733709834516048,0,0,-0.023467419669032097,0,0,0,0,0,-0.019556183367967606,0,0.07822473347187042,0.019556183367967606,0,-0.06257978081703186,-0.03520112857222557,0,0.03128989040851593,0,0,-0.18773935735225677,-0.2464078962802887,0,0,0.015644945204257965,0,-0.015644945204257965,-0.023467419669032097,0,0,0.011733709834516048,0,-0.03128989040851593,-0.011733709834516048,0,0.20338429510593414,0.06257978081703186,0,-0.07822473347187042,-0.07040225714445114,0,0.14080451428890228,0.027378655970096588,0,-0.015644945204257965,-0.03911236673593521,0,0.03128989040851593,0.011733709834516048,0,-0.03128989040851593,-0.003911236301064491,0,0.03128989040851593,0.003911236301064491,0,-0.046934839338064194,-0.011733709834516048,0,0.20338429510593414,0.015644945204257965,0,-0.09386967867612839,-0.019556183367967606,0,0.03128989040851593,0,0,0,-0.007822472602128983,0,0.015644945204257965,0.007822472602128983,0,-0.03128989040851593,-0.03128989040851593,0,0,0.015644945204257965,0,-0.015644945204257965,-0.03128989040851593,0,0.1720944046974182,0.04302360117435455,0,-0.06257978081703186,-0.023467419669032097,0,0.015644945204257965,0.027378655970096588,0,-0.046934839338064194,0,0,0.03128989040851593,0.03520112857222557,0,-0.015644945204257965,-0.027378655970096588,0,0.015644945204257965,0.007822472602128983,0,-0.06257978081703186,-0.003911236301064491,0,0,0.046934839338064194,0,-0.15644946694374084,-0.03520112857222557,0,0.046934839338064194,0.015644945204257965,0,0,-0.10169214755296707,0,0.06257978081703186,0,0,-0.25031912326812744,-0.007822472602128983,0,0,0.007822472602128983,0,-0.015644945204257965,-0.03128989040851593,0,0.015644945204257965,0.10169214755296707,0,-0.015644945204257965,-0.1603606939315796,0,0.1720944046974182,0.07431349158287048,0,-0.015644945204257965,-0.019556183367967606,0,0.03128989040851593,0.019556183367967606,0,-0.015644945204257965,-0.015644945204257965,0,0.015644945204257965,0.046934839338064194,0,-0.12515956163406372,-0.05866854637861252,0,0.03128989040851593,0.1134258583188057,0,-0.015644945204257965,-0.054757311940193176,0,0.015644945204257965,0.019556183367967606,0,-0.06257978081703186,0,0,0.015644945204257965,0.007822472602128983,0,-0.07822473347187042,-0.019556183367967606,0,0.046934839338064194,0.007822472602128983,0,-0.03128989040851593,-0.011733709834516048,0,0,0.0860472023487091,0,-0.07822473347187042,-0.03128989040851593,0,0.015644945204257965,0.011733709834516048,0,-0.015644945204257965,-0.03520112857222557,0,0,0.019556183367967606,0,-0.015644945204257965,-0.019556183367967606,0,0.03128989040851593,0.027378655970096588,0,0,-0.04302360117435455,0,0.015644945204257965,0,0,-0.046934839338064194,-0.07822473347187042,0,0,0.03911236673593521,0,0,0,0,0.015644945204257965,0.03128989040851593,0,-0.09386967867612839,-0.12515956163406372,0,0.015644945204257965,0.019556183367967606,0,-0.015644945204257965,-0.023467419669032097,0,0.015644945204257965,0.015644945204257965,0,-0.015644945204257965,-0.054757311940193176,0,0,0.0860472023487091,0,-0.046934839338064194,-0.011733709834516048,0,0,0.015644945204257965,0,-0.03128989040851593,-0.015644945204257965,0,0,0.05866854637861252,0,-0.03128989040851593,-0.08213596791028976,0,0.03128989040851593,0.050846073776483536,0,-0.03128989040851593,-0.011733709834516048,0,0.015644945204257965,0.015644945204257965,0,0,-0.03911236673593521,0,0.10951462388038635,0.015644945204257965,0,0,-0.050846073776483536,0,0.015644945204257965,0.07431349158287048,0,-0.10951462388038635,-0.03911236673593521,0,0.03128989040851593,0.007822472602128983,0,-0.015644945204257965,-0.03911236673593521,0,0.03128989040851593,0.011733709834516048,0,-0.015644945204257965,-0.015644945204257965,0,0,0,0,-0.03128989040851593,-0.011733709834516048,0,0,0.05866854637861252,0,0,-0.015644945204257965,0,0.03128989040851593,0.011733709834516048,0,-0.0625797

the letters.  By POKEing the appropriate\nsection of Color RAM, you can change the color of a whole section of\ntext on the screen without affecting the content of the text.  You can\neven use this method to make letters disappear by changing their\nforeground colors to match the background (or by changing the\nbackground to match the foreground), and later make them reappear by\nchanging them back, or by changing the background to a contrasting\ncolor.  An interesting example program which changes Color RAM quickly\nin BASIC can be found under the entry for 648 ($288).\n\nA change in the Operating System causes newer 64s to set all of the\nColor RAM locations to the same value as the current background color\nwhenever the screen is cleared.  Therefore, POKEing character codes to\nthe Screen RAM area will not appear to have any effect, because the\nletters will be the same color as the background.  This can easily be\nturned to your advantage, however, because it means that all you have\nto do to set all of Color RAM to a particular value is to set the\nbackground color to that value (using the register at 53281 ($D021)),\nclear the screen, and return the background color in the desired\nvalue.\n\nThe various garphics modes use this area differently than does the\nregular text mode.  In high-resolution bitmap mode, this area is not\nused at all, but in multicolor bitmap mode it is used to determine the\ncolor of the 11 bit-pair for a given 8 by 8 dot area.","sourcePath":"external/zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/c64/manuals/mapping-c64.txt","sourceMtimeMs":1761327822859,"origin":"external/zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/c64/manuals/mapping-c64.txt#54293-D415-CUTLO-8"},{"name":"zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/c64/manuals/mapping-c64.txt","language":"hardware","vector":[0,0,0,0,-0.034561265259981155,0,0.03949858993291855,0.029623940587043762,0,-0.11849576234817505,-0.009874647483229637,0,0.019749294966459274,0.004937323741614819,0,-0.03949858993291855,-0.059247881174087524,0,0.03949858993291855,0.034561265259981155,0,-0.019749294966459274,-0.019749294966459274,0,0.019749294966459274,0.009874647483229637,0,-0.019749294966459274,-0.009874647483229637,0,0.019749294966459274,0.11849576234817505,0,-0.03949858993291855,-0.014811970293521881,0,0,0.019749294966459274,0,0,-0.029623940587043762,0,0.03949858993291855,0.014811970293521881,0,0,-0.034561265259981155,0,0.019749294966459274,0.004937323741614819,0,-0.17774364352226257,-0.049373235553503036,0,0.1579943597316742,0.019749294966459274,0,0,-0.014811970293521881,0,0.019749294966459274,0.03949858993291855,0,0,-0.009874647483229637,0,0,0.03949858993291855,0,0,0,0,0,0.014811970293521881,0,0,-0.024686617776751518,0,0.0789971798658371,0.009874647483229637,0,-0.0789971798658371,-0.024686617776751518,0,0.03949858993291855,0.019749294966459274,0,-0.19749294221401215,-0.20243026316165924,0,0,0.009874647483229637,0,-0.019749294966459274,-0.04443591088056564,0,0,0,0,-0.03949858993291855,-0.009874647483229637,0,0.3752366006374359,0.019749294966459274,0,-0.09874647110700607,-0.059247881174087524,0,0.03949858993291855,0.029623940587043762,0,0,-0.024686617776751518,0,0.019749294966459274,0.019749294966459274,0,-0.03949858993291855,-0.014811970293521881,0,0.03949858993291855,0.019749294966459274,0,0,-0.009874647483229637,0,0.17774364352226257,0.009874647483229637,0,0,-0.019749294966459274,0,0,0.009874647483229637,0,0,-0.009874647483229637,0,0,0.024686617776751518,0,0,-0.004937323741614819,0,0.019749294966459274,0.03949858993291855,0,-0.019749294966459274,-0.09380915015935898,0,0.13824506103992462,0.08393450081348419,0,-0.03949858993291855,-0.014811970293521881,0,0.03949858993291855,0.014811970293521881,0,-0.03949858993291855,-0.004937323741614819,0,0.019749294966459274,0,0,-0.019749294966459274,-0.019749294966459274,0,0,0.004937323741614819,0,-0.0789971798658371,-0.004937323741614819,0,0,0.05431056022644043,0,-0.09874647110700607,-0.03949858993291855,0,0.03949858993291855,0.03949858993291855,0,-0.03949858993291855,-0.09874647110700607,0,0.019749294966459274,0.004937323741614819,0,-0.2369915246963501,-0.014811970293521881,0,0.059247881174087524,0,0,0,-0.029623940587043762,0,0,0.18761830031871796,0,0,-0.1481197029352188,0,0.2369915246963501,0.024686617776751518,0,-0.019749294966459274,-0.019749294966459274,0,0.03949858993291855,0.009874647483229637,0,0,-0.019749294966459274,0,0.019749294966459274,0.029623940587043762,0,-0.09874647110700607,-0.029623940587043762,0,0.019749294966459274,0.09380915015935898,0,-0.03949858993291855,-0.009874647483229637,0,0.03949858993291855,0.009874647483229637,0,-0.019749294966459274,-0.004937323741614819,0,0.03949858993291855,0.004937323741614819,0,-0.03949858993291855,-0.004937323741614819,0,0,0.014811970293521881,0,0,-0.019749294966459274,0,0.019749294966459274,0.06912253051996231,0,-0.059247881174087524,-0.019749294966459274,0,0.03949858993291855,0.029623940587043762,0,-0.019749294966459274,-0.019749294966459274,0,0.0789971798658371,0.014811970293521881,0,-0.019749294966459274,-0.05431056022644043,0,0,0.03949858993291855,0,-0.019749294966459274,-0.03949858993291855,0,0,0.004937323741614819,0,-0.03949858993291855,-0.049373235553503036,0,0,0.019749294966459274,0,0,-0.019749294966459274,0,0.0789971798658371,0.009874647483229637,0,-0.019749294966459274,-0.11849576234817505,0,0,0.049373235553503036,0,-0.019749294966459274,-0.019749294966459274,0,0.03949858993291855,0.009874647483229637,0,0,-0.049373235553503036,0,0,0.11849576234817505,0,0,-0.014811970293521881,0,0.03949858993291855,0.019749294966459274,0,-0.03949858993291855,-0.009874647483229637,0,0.019749294966459274,0.10368379205465317,0,-0.019749294966459274,-0.0740598514676094,0,0.11849576234817505,0.019749294966459274,0,-0.019749294966459274,-0.019749294966459274,0,0.019749294966459274,0.024686617776751518,0,-0.059247881174087524,-0.019749294966459274,0,0.019749294966459274,0.029623940587043762,0,-0.019749294966459274,-0.019749294966459274,0,0,0.04443591088056564,0,-0.0789971798658371,0,0,0.019749294966459274,0.009874647483229637,0,-0.019749294966459274,-0.029623940587043762,0,0.059247881174087524,0.019749294966459274,0,0,-0.009874647483229637,0,0.0789971798658371,0.04443591088056564,0,0,-0.014811970293521881,0,0.019749294966459274,0.034561265259981155,0,-0.019749294966459274,-0.019749294966459274,0,0,0.009874647483229637,0,-0.03949858993291855,-0.029623940587043762,0,0,0.004937323741614819,0,-0.3949858844280243,-0.004937323741614819,0,0.019749294966459274,

cleared a\nscreen line set the corresponding Color RAM to a value of 1, which\ngives text characters a white foreground color.  This was changed when\nthe white color was found to sometimes cause light flashes during\nscreen scrolling.  It was that white foreground color, however, that\nenabled the user to POKE the screen code for a character into screen\nRAM, and make that character appear on the screen in a color that\ncontrasted the blue background.  This change to the Operating System\ncauses colors POKEd to screen RAM to be the same color as the\nbackground, and thus they are invisible.\n\nThis is a fairly serious problem, because the technique of POKEing\ncharacters to screen RAM has long been a staple of Commodore graphics\nprogramming.  Fortunately, the problem has an easy colution.  Since\nthe Color RAM will be set to whatevere color is in Background Color\nRegister 0, what you have to do to initialize Color RAM to the color\nyou desire is change the background color to the desired foreground\ncolor, clear the screen, and then change the background color back\nagain:","sourcePath":"external/zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/c64/manuals/mapping-c64.txt","sourceMtimeMs":1761327822859,"origin":"external/zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/c64/manuals/mapping-c64.txt#POKE-648AD256-REM-AD-IS-THE-ACTUAL-ADDRESS-OF-SCREEN-MEMORY-26"},{"name":"zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/c64/manuals/mapping-c64.txt","language":"hardware","vector":[0.030324792489409447,0,0,-0.030324792489409447,-0.007581198122352362,0,0,0.045487191528081894,0,-0.09097438305616379,-0.06823078542947769,0,0.030324792489409447,0.022743595764040947,0,-0.09097438305616379,-0.022743595764040947,0,0.12129916995763779,0,0,0,0,0,0.030324792489409447,0.06064958497881889,0,-0.030324792489409447,-0.022743595764040947,0,0,0.045487191528081894,0,-0.030324792489409447,-0.015162396244704723,0,0,0.015162396244704723,0,0,0,0,0.12129916995763779,0.06064958497881889,0,0,-0.007581198122352362,0,0,0,0,0,-0.007581198122352362,0,0.09097438305616379,0,0,-0.030324792489409447,0,0,0,0.030324792489409447,0,-0.030324792489409447,-0.037905991077423096,0,0,0.007581198122352362,0,-0.09097438305616379,0,0,0,0.015162396244704723,0,-0.030324792489409447,-0.007581198122352362,0,0,0.015162396244704723,0,-0.18194876611232758,-0.015162396244704723,0,0.030324792489409447,0.007581198122352362,0,-0.15162396430969238,-0.20469234883785248,0,0,0.030324792489409447,0,-0.030324792489409447,-0.022743595764040947,0,0.09097438305616379,0.022743595764040947,0,0,-0.022743595764040947,0,0.39422231912612915,0,0,0,-0.053068388253450394,0,0,0.015162396244704723,0,0,-0.045487191528081894,0,0.06064958497881889,0.06064958497881889,0,-0.12129916995763779,0,0,0,0.030324792489409447,0,0,-0.037905991077423096,0,0.30324792861938477,0.007581198122352362,0,-0.09097438305616379,-0.022743595764040947,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.030324792489409447,0.06823078542947769,0,0,-0.007581198122352362,0,0.030324792489409447,0.015162396244704723,0,-0.030324792489409447,0,0,0.21227355301380157,0.053068388253450394,0,0,-0.015162396244704723,0,0,0.030324792489409447,0,0,-0.015162396244704723,0,0,0,0,0,-0.045487191528081894,0,0,0,0,-0.030324792489409447,-0.015162396244704723,0,0,0.015162396244704723,0,-0.030324792489409447,-0.09855557978153229,0,0.06064958497881889,0.015162396244704723,0,-0.09097438305616379,-0.07581198215484619,0,0.030324792489409447,0,0,-0.030324792489409447,-0.015162396244704723,0,0,0.053068388253450394,0,0,-0.007581198122352362,0,0.18194876611232758,0.19711115956306458,0,-0.030324792489409447,-0.09855557978153229,0,0.06064958497881889,0.015162396244704723,0,-0.06064958497881889,-0.007581198122352362,0,0,0.037905991077423096,0,0,-0.06823078542947769,0,0,0,0,-0.030324792489409447,-0.022743595764040947,0,0,0.15920516848564148,0,-0.030324792489409447,-0.06823078542947769,0,0,0.030324792489409447,0,0,0,0,0,0.022743595764040947,0,-0.09097438305616379,-0.007581198122352362,0,0.030324792489409447,0.015162396244704723,0,0,-0.022743595764040947,0,0.06064958497881889,0.10613677650690079,0,-0.030324792489409447,0,0,0,0.030324792489409447,0,0,0,0,0.030324792489409447,0,0,-0.030324792489409447,0,0,0,0.022743595764040947,0,-0.030324792489409447,-0.022743595764040947,0,0.030324792489409447,0,0,-0.030324792489409447,-0.022743595764040947,0,0,0.030324792489409447,0,-0.030324792489409447,-0.06823078542947769,0,0,0.015162396244704723,0,0,-0.022743595764040947,0,0,0,0,0,-0.045487191528081894,0,0.06064958497881889,0.09855557978153229,0,-0.09097438305616379,-0.053068388253450394,0,0.030324792489409447,0.030324792489409447,0,-0.030324792489409447,-0.037905991077423096,0,0,0.022743595764040947,0,0,0,0,0.030324792489409447,0.09855557978153229,0,-0.030324792489409447,-0.015162396244704723,0,0.06064958497881889,0,0,0,-0.015162396244704723,0,0.030324792489409447,0.015162396244704723,0,0,-0.030324792489409447,0,0.12129916995763779,0,0,0,-0.045487191528081894,0,0,0.09097438305616379,0,0,-0.022743595764040947,0,0,0.030324792489409447,0,0,-0.015162396244704723,0,0.06064958497881889,0.007581198122352362,0,-0.030324792489409447,0,0,0,0.022743595764040947,0,0,-0.022743595764040947,0,0,0.053068388253450394,0,0,-0.015162396244704723,0,0.030324792489409447,0.015162396244704723,0,-0.030324792489409447,-0.015162396244704723,0,0,0,0,-0.39422231912612915,-0.015162396244704723,0,0.06064958497881889,0,0,-0.030324792489409447,-0.007581198122352362,0],"text":"<!-- Source: external/zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/c64/manuals/mapping-c64.txt#60684-ED0C-LISTEN-26 -->\nThis table contains the ten prescaler values for the ten standard baud\nrates implemented by the RS-232 Control Register at 659 ($293).  The\ntable starts with the two values needed for the lowest baud rate (50\nbaud) and finishes with the entries for the highest baud rate, 2400\nbaud.  The RS-232 routines are handled by NMI interrupts which are\ncaused by the timers on CIA #2.  Since the RS-232 device could both\nreceive and send a bit in a single cycle, the time between interrupts\nshould be a little less than half of the clock frequency divided by\nthe baud rate.  The exact formula used is:","sourcePath":"external/zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/c64/manuals/mapping-c64.txt","sourceMtimeMs":1761327822859,"origin":"external/zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/c64/manuals/mapping-c64.txt#60684-ED0C-LISTEN-26"},{"name":"zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/c64/manuals/mapping-c64.txt","language":"hardware","vector":[0,0,0,-0.03519076853990555,-0.03519076853990555,0,0.1407630741596222,0.017595384269952774,0,-0.0703815370798111,-0.026393074542284012,0,0.03519076853990555,0.017595384269952774,0,-0.03519076853990555,-0.06158384308218956,0,0.03519076853990555,0,0,0,-0.008797692134976387,0,0.03519076853990555,0.017595384269952774,0,0,-0.026393074542284012,0,0,0.0703815370798111,0,-0.03519076853990555,-0.017595384269952774,0,0,0.03519076853990555,0,0,-0.017595384269952774,0,0.03519076853990555,0,0,0,-0.008797692134976387,0,0,0,0,0,-0.008797692134976387,0,0.1407630741596222,0.026393074542284012,0,0,0,0,0,0.017595384269952774,0,0,0,0,0.03519076853990555,0.026393074542284012,0,0,-0.017595384269952774,0,0.03519076853990555,0,0,0,-0.026393074542284012,0,0,0.008797692134976387,0,-0.0703815370798111,-0.017595384269952774,0,0,0.03519076853990555,0,-0.0703815370798111,-0.07917922735214233,0,0,0.017595384269952774,0,-0.03519076853990555,-0.052786149084568024,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03519076853990555,0,0.31671690940856934,0.07917922735214233,0,-0.03519076853990555,-0.03519076853990555,0,0.03519076853990555,0.017595384269952774,0,0,-0.017595384269952774,0,0.03519076853990555,0.017595384269952774,0,-0.2815261483192444,-0.008797692134976387,0,0.03519076853990555,0.017595384269952774,0,0,-0.008797692134976387,0,0.2815261483192444,0.008797692134976387,0,-0.03519076853990555,-0.026393074542284012,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.10557229816913605,0.026393074542284012,0,-0.0703815370798111,-0.008797692134976387,0,0,0.008797692134976387,0,-0.03519076853990555,0,0,0.38709843158721924,0.08797691762447357,0,-0.03519076853990555,-0.008797692134976387,0,0,0,0,-0.03519076853990555,0,0,0.03519076853990555,0.017595384269952774,0,0,0,0,0,0.017595384269952774,0,-0.17595383524894714,0,0,0,0.008797692134976387,0,-0.0703815370798111,-0.03519076853990555,0,0.0703815370798111,0.008797692134976387,0,-0.03519076853990555,-0.043988458812236786,0,0,0,0,-0.17595383524894714,-0.026393074542284012,0,0,0,0,-0.03519076853990555,0,0,0,0.15835845470428467,0,-0.03519076853990555,-0.052786149084568024,0,0.2111445963382721,0.017595384269952774,0,-0.0703815370798111,-0.026393074542284012,0,0,0.017595384269952774,0,0,-0.14956076443195343,0,0,0.052786149084568024,0,-0.03519076853990555,-0.017595384269952774,0,0,0.14956076443195343,0,-0.03519076853990555,-0.026393074542284012,0,0.10557229816913605,0.008797692134976387,0,0,0,0,0,0.06158384308218956,0,0,-0.03519076853990555,0,0.03519076853990555,0,0,0,-0.026393074542284012,0,0,0.19354921579360962,0,-0.03519076853990555,-0.017595384269952774,0,0.03519076853990555,0.008797692134976387,0,-0.0703815370798111,-0.017595384269952774,0,0.1407630741596222,0.017595384269952774,0,-0.03519076853990555,0,0,0.0703815370798111,0.03519076853990555,0,0,-0.08797691762447357,0,0,0,0,-0.0703815370798111,-0.03519076853990555,0,0.03519076853990555,0.043988458812236786,0,0,-0.017595384269952774,0,0,0.008797692134976387,0,0,-0.08797691762447357,0,0,0,0,-0.03519076853990555,-0.03519076853990555,0,0,0,0,-0.03519076853990555,-0.03519076853990555,0,0.03519076853990555,0.10557229816913605,0,-0.03519076853990555,-0.043988458812236786,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03519076853990555,0.07917922735214233,0,-0.03519076853990555,-0.026393074542284012,0,0.03519076853990555,0.008797692134976387,0,0,-0.017595384269952774,0,0.0703815370798111,0.06158384308218956,0,-0.03519076853990555,-0.0703815370798111,0,0,0.008797692134976387,0,0,0,0,0,0.08797691762447357,0,0,-0.008797692134976387,0,0,0,0,0,-0.017595384269952774,0,0.03519076853990555,0.043988458812236786,0,0,-0.052786149084568024,0,0.03519076853990555,0.0703815370798111,0,-0.03519076853990555,-0.026393074542284012,0,0,0.13196538388729095,0,-0.03519076853990555,-0.008797692134976387,0,0,0,0,0,-0.043988458812236786,0,0,0.026393074542284012,0,-0.1407630741596222,0,0,0,0,0,-0.10557229816913605,-0.043988458812236786,0],"text":"<!-- Source: external/zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/c64/manuals/mapping-c64.txt#CLOCKBAUD2-100-4 -->\nAs an additional aid, some of these routines are also vectored through\nthe table which starts at 788 ($314).

The\n                                SETLFS, $FFBA, and SETNAM, $FFBD, routines must be used before calling this\n                                routine. However, a file name is not required to SAVE to device 1, the cassette.\n                                Any attempt to save to other devices without using a file name results in an error.\n                                NOTE: device 0, the keyboard, and device 3, the screen, cannot be SAVEd to.

The clock is three bytes long which gives the capability\n                                to count from zero up to 5,184,000 jiffies - 24 hours plus one jiffy.

Before calling this routine to set the clock the new time,\n                                in jiffies, should be in YXA, the accumulator containing the most significant byte.\n.,FFDB 4C E4 F6 JMP $F6E4       set real time clock","sourcePath":"external/zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/src/c64/c64_rom_disassembly.txt","sourceMtimeMs":1761327707556,"origin":"external/zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/src/c64/c64_rom_disassembly.txt#Page-1-278"},{"name":"zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt","language":"hardware","vector":[0.001631090883165598,0.0005436969804577529,0,0,-0.0004077727207913995,0,0.0005436969804577529,0.000815545441582799,0,0,-0.0004077727207913995,0,0.0005436969804577529,0.0009514697012491524,0,-0.001631090883165598,-0.00013592424511443824,0,0.0010873939609155059,0.00027184849022887647,0,-0.0021747879218310118,-0.0005436969804577529,0,0,0.0010873939609155059,0,0,0,0,0.0010873939609155059,0.002854409161955118,0,-0.0010873939609155059,0,0,0,0.0006796212401241064,0,-0.0005436969804577529,-0.0014951666817069054,0,0,0.0005436969804577529,0,0,-0.0004077727207913995,0,0.0005436969804577529,0.00027184849022887647,0,0,-0.0004077727207913995,0,0.0010873939609155059,0.00027184849022887647,0,-0.0005436969804577529,0,0,0.0005436969804577529,0,0,-0.006524363532662392,-0.0010873939609155059,0,0.0005436969804577529,0,0,0,-0.0012233181623741984,0,0,0,0,-0.0027184849604964256,0,0,0.005436969920992851,0.0006796212401241064,0,-0.0010873939609155059,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.0012233181623741984,0,0.0010873939609155059,0.0010873939609155059,0,-0.0005436969804577529,-0.0004077727207913995,0,0.0005436969804577529,0.0009514697012491524,0,0,0,0,0.007611757609993219,0.00027184849022887647,0,0,0,0,0,0.0004077727207913995,0,0,-0.000815545441582799,0,0.003262181766331196,0.000815545441582799,0,-0.0005436969804577529,-0.0010873939609155059,0,0.0027184849604964256,0.00027184849022887647,0,0,-0.00013592424511443824,0,0.8726336359977722,0.0006796212401241064,0,-0.0005436969804577529,-0.0005436969804577529,0,0.001631090883165598,0,0,0,-0.0004077727207913995,0,0.0005436969804577529,0.0005436969804577529,0,-0.0010873939609155059,0,0,0,0.001631090883165598,0,-0.003262181766331196,0,0,0.0027184849604964256,0.000815545441582799,0,-0.0010873939609155059,-0.0009514697012491524,0,0.0010873939609155059,0.0004077727207913995,0,0,-0.003262181766331196,0,0,0.00027184849022887647,0,0,0,0,0.0027184849604964256,0.00013592424511443824,0,0,-0.0013592424802482128,0,0,0.0027184849604964256,0,-0.001631090883165598,-0.0010873939609155059,0,0.0010873939609155059,0,0,-0.0005436969804577529,-0.0005436969804577529,0,0.0027184849604964256,0.0005436969804577529,0,-0.0005436969804577529,-0.00027184849022887647,0,0.0010873939609155059,0.00027184849022887647,0,-0.0010873939609155059,0,0,0,0.0038058788049966097,0,0,-0.00027184849022887647,0,0.0005436969804577529,0.0004077727207913995,0,0,-0.00013592424511443824,0,0.0005436969804577529,0.0020388637203723192,0,-0.0005436969804577529,-0.00027184849022887647,0,0.0010873939609155059,0.0014951666817069054,0,-0.001631090883165598,0,0,0.0010873939609155059,0.4364527463912964,0,-0.001631090883165598,-0.0006796212401241064,0,0,0.0010873939609155059,0,0,-0.0005436969804577529,0,0,0.00027184849022887647,0,0,-0.0005436969804577529,0,0,0.00027184849022887647,0,-0.0005436969804577529,-0.0019029394024983048,0,0,0.0013592424802482128,0,0,-0.0006796212401241064,0,0.0027184849604964256,0.0005436969804577529,0,0,0,0,0,0.00013592424511443824,0,-0.0027184849604964256,0,0,0.0010873939609155059,0.001631090883165598,0,-0.0005436969804577529,-0.00013592424511443824,0,0.0005436969804577529,0.00013592424511443824,0,0,-0.002446636324748397,0,0,0.0006796212401241064,0,0,-0.00027184849022887647,0,0.0005436969804577529,0.0013592424802482128,0,0,-0.0009514697012491524,0,0.0010873939609155059,0.0019029394024983048,0,0,-0.000815545441582799,0,0.0010873939609155059,0,0,-0.0005436969804577529,0,0,0.0005436969804577529,0.0005436969804577529,0,0,-0.00013592424511443824,0,0,0.0004077727207913995,0,-0.0005436969804577529,-0.00027184849022887647,0,0.0021747879218310118,0.002446636324748397,0,0,-0.000815545441582799,0,0.005436969920992851,0.0005436969804577529,0,0,-0.000815545441582799,0,0.0010873939609155059,0.000815545441582799,0,-0.0027184849604964256,-0.00013592424511443824,0,0.0005436969804577529,0.0006796212401241064,0,0,0,0,0,0.21815840899944305,0,0,-0.0004077727207913995,0,0.0005436969804577529,0.0004077727207913995,0,0,0,0,0,0.0014951666817069054,0,-0.0021747879218310118,-0.00027184849022887647,0,0,0,0,-0.0021747879218310118,-0.0021747879218310118,0,0,0.0012233181623741984,0,0,-0.0005436969804577529,0,0,0.0005436969804577529,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.0010873939609155059,0,0,0.001631090883165598,0.0009514697012491524,0,-0.0005436969804577529,0,0],"text":"<!-- Source: external/zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt#TABLE-OF-CONTENTS-4 -->\n3.

hierarchy. In other words, certain operations are performed be-\n  fore other operations. The normal order of operations can be modified\n  by enclosing two or more operands within parentheses ( ), creating a\n  \"subexpression.\" The parts of an expression enclosed in parentheses will\n  be reduced to a single value before working on parts outside the par-\n  entheses.\n    When you use parentheses in expressions, they must be paired so that\n  you always have an equal number of left and right parentheses. Otherwise,\n  the BASIC error message ?SYNTAX ERROR will appear.\n    Expressions which have operands inside parentheses may themselves\n  be enclosed in parentheses, forming complex expressions of multiple\n  levels. This is called nesting. Parentheses can be nested in expressions\n  to a maximum depth of ten levels-ten matching sets of parentheses.\n  The inner-most expression has its operations performed first.

known as the VIC-II chip). This chip gives a\n  variety of graphics modes, including a 40 column by 25 line text display,\n  a 320 by 200 dot high resolution display, and SPRITES, small movable\n  objects which make writing games simple. And if this weren't enough,\n  many of the graphics modes can be mixed on the same screen. It is\n  possible, for example, to define the top half of the screen to be in\n  high resolution mode, while the bottom half is in text mode. And SPRITES\n  will combine with anything! More on sprites later. First the other\n  graphics modes.\n    The VIC-II chip has the following graphics display

Source: external/zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt#GRAPHICS-LOCATIONS -->\nGRAPHICS LOCATIONS\n\nSome general information first. There are 1000 possible locations on\n  the Commodore 64 screen. Normally, the screen starts at location 1024\n  ($0400 in HEXadecimal notation) and goes to location 2023. Each of\n  these locations is 8 bits wide. This means that it can hold any integer\n  number from 0 to 255. Connected with screen memory is a group of 1000\n  locations called COLOR MEMORY or COLOR RAM. These start at location 55296\n  ($D800 in HEX) and go up to 56295. Each of the color RAM locations is 4\n  bits wide, which means that it can hold any integer number from 0 to 15.\n  Since there are 16 possible colors that the Commodore 64 can use, this\n  works out well.\n    In addition, there are 256 different characters that can be displayed\n  at any time. For normal screen display, each of the 1000 locations in\n  screen memory contains a code number which tells the VIC-II chip which\n  character to display at that screen location.\n    The various graphics modes are selected by the 47 CONTROL registers in\n  the VIC-II chip. Many of the graphics functions can be controlled by\n  POKEing the correct value into one of the registers.

Source: external/zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt#SPRITES -->\nSPRITES\n\nA SPRITE is a special type of user definable character which can be\n  displayed anywhere on the screen. Sprites are maintained directly by the\n  VIC-II chip. And all you have to do is tell a sprite \"what to look like,\"\n  \"what color to be,\" and \"where to appear.\" The VIC-II chip will do the\n  rest! Sprites can be any of the 16 colors available.\n    Sprites can be used with ANY of the other graphics modes, bit mapped,\n  character, multi-color, etc., and they'll keep their shape in all of\n  them. The sprite carries its own color definition, its own mode (HI-RES\n  or multi-colored), and its own shape.\n    Up to 8 sprites at a time can be maintained by the VIC-II chip auto-\n  matically. More sprites can be displayed using RASTER INTERRUPT\n  techniques.\n\nThe features of SPRITES include:\n\n1) 24 horizontal dot by 21 vertical dot size.\n    2) Individual color control for each sprite.\n    3) Sprite multi-color mode.\n    4) Magnification (2x) in horizontal, vertical, or both directions.\n    5) Selectable sprite to background priority.\n    6) Fixed sprite to sprite priorities.\n    7) Sprite to sprite collision detection.\n    8) Sprite to background collision detection.","sourcePath":"external/zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt","sourceMtimeMs":1761327714834,"origin":"external/zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt#SPRITES"},{"name":"zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt","language":"hardware","vector":[0,0.011830384843051434,0,0,-0.011830384843051434,0,0,0.035491153597831726,0,0,-0.035491153597831726,0,0.18928615748882294,0.023660769686102867,0,0,-0.09464307874441147,0,0.047321539372205734,0.023660769686102867,0,0,-0.011830384843051434,0,0.047321539372205734,0,0,0,0,0,0.047321539372205734,0.05915192514657974,0,0,-0.023660769686102867,0,0,0.05915192514657974,0,0,0,0,0,0.047321539372205734,0,0,-0.023660769686102867,0,0.047321539372205734,0,0,-0.047321539372205734,-0.023660769686102867,0,0.047321539372205734,0.10647346824407578,0,0,0,0,0,0.011830384843051434,0,-0.047321539372205734,-0.035491153597831726,0,0,0.035491153597831726,0,0,0,0,0.047321539372205734,0.011830384843051434,0,0,-0.011830384843051434,0,0,0.023660769686102867,0,-0.23660770058631897,-0.011830384843051434,0,0,0,0,-0.047321539372205734,-0.09464307874441147,0,0,0,0,-0.047321539372205734,-0.047321539372205734,0,0,0,0,-0.047321539372205734,-0.011830384843051434,0,0.33125078678131104,0.011830384843051434,0,0,0,0,0,0.09464307874441147,0,-0.047321539372205734,0,0,0.047321539372205734,0.023660769686102867,0,-0.047321539372205734,0,0,0,0.023660769686102867,0,0,0,0,0.2839292287826538,0.035491153597831726,0,0,-0.023660769686102867,0,0.047321539372205734,0.011830384843051434,0,-0.047321539372205734,0,0,0,0,0,-0.09464307874441147,0,0,0.047321539372205734,0.035491153597831726,0,0,-0.023660769686102867,0,0.2839292287826538,0.047321539372205734,0,-0.047321539372205734,0,0,0,0.023660769686102867,0,-0.09464307874441147,-0.023660769686102867,0,0,0,0,-0.047321539372205734,0,0,0,0.047321539372205734,0,0,0,0,0.047321539372205734,0,0,-0.047321539372205734,-0.1301342397928238,0,0.1419646143913269,0.011830384843051434,0,-0.1419646143913269,-0.023660769686102867,0,0,0,0,-0.18928615748882294,-0.023660769686102867,0,0,0.011830384843051434,0,-0.047321539372205734,-0.023660769686102867,0,0,0.16562539339065552,0,0,-0.035491153597831726,0,0.1419646143913269,0,0,-0.09464307874441147,-0.035491153597831726,0,0.047321539372205734,0.023660769686102867,0,0,-0.023660769686102867,0,0,0,0,-0.09464307874441147,0,0,0,0.18928615748882294,0,-0.09464307874441147,0,0,0.23660770058631897,0.035491153597831726,0,0,-0.023660769686102867,0,0.047321539372205734,0.011830384843051434,0,-0.047321539372205734,-0.047321539372205734,0,0.047321539372205734,0.035491153597831726,0,0,0,0,0.047321539372205734,0.1419646143913269,0,-0.047321539372205734,-0.023660769686102867,0,0,0,0,-0.047321539372205734,-0.047321539372205734,0,0,0.011830384843051434,0,-0.09464307874441147,-0.035491153597831726,0,0,0.011830384843051434,0,-0.09464307874441147,0,0,0,0.023660769686102867,0,-0.047321539372205734,-0.035491153597831726,0,0.047321539372205734,0.07098230719566345,0,0,-0.07098230719566345,0,0,0.011830384843051434,0,0,-0.09464307874441147,0,0,0,0,0,-0.08281269669532776,0,0,0,0,0,-0.011830384843051434,0,0.047321539372205734,0.07098230719566345,0,-0.09464307874441147,-0.05915192514657974,0,0.047321539372205734,0.023660769686102867,0,0,-0.011830384843051434,0,0,0.08281269669532776,0,0,-0.047321539372205734,0,0.047321539372205734,0,0,0,-0.05915192514657974,0,0.09464307874441147,0.1301342397928238,0,0,-0.011830384843051434,0,0.09464307874441147,0.023660769686102867,0,0,-0.023660769686102867,0,0,0.09464307874441147,0,0,0,0,0.09464307874441147,0.035491153597831726,0,0,-0.035491153597831726,0,0,0,0,-0.047321539372205734,-0.047321539372205734,0,0.047321539372205734,0.011830384843051434,0,0,-0.047321539372205734,0,0,0.07098230719566345,0,0,-0.05915192514657974,0,0.047321539372205734,0,0,0,-0.047321539372205734,0,0,0.023660769686102867,0,-0.1419646143913269,-0.011830384843051434,0,0,0,0,-0.047321539372205734,0,0],"text":"<!-- Source: external/zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt#SPRITES-2 -->\nThese special sprite abilities make it simple to program many arcade\n  style games.

direction, or both at once.

Source: external/zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt#SPRITE-POSITIONING -->\nSPRITE POSITIONING\n\nOnce you've made a sprite you want to be able to move it around the\n  screen. To do this, your Commodore 64 uses three positioning registers:\n\n1) SPRITE X POSITION REGISTER\n    2) SPRITE Y POSITION REGISTER\n    3) MOST SIGNIFICANT BIT X POSITION REGISTER\n\nEach sprite has an X position register, a Y position register, and a\n  bit in the X most significant bit register. This lets you position your\n  sprites very accurately. You can place your sprite in 512 possible X\n  positions and 256 possible Y positions.\n    The X and Y position registers work together, in pairs, as a team. The\n  locations of the X and Y registers appear in the memory map as follows:\n  First is the X register for sprite 0, then the Y register for sprite 0.\n\nPROGRAMMING GRAPHICS   137\n~\n\nNext comes the X register for sprite 1, the Y register for sprite 1, and\n  so on. After all 16 X and Y registers comes the most significant bit in\n  the X position (X MSB) located in its own register.\n    The chart below lists the locations of each sprite position register.\n  You use the locations at their appropriate time through POKE statements:","sourcePath":"external/zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt","sourceMtimeMs":1761327714834,"origin":"external/zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt#SPRITE-POSITIONING"},{"name":"zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt","language":"hardware","vector":[0,0,0,0,-0.04906180500984192,0,0,0.06541574001312256,0,-0.03270787000656128,-0.02453090250492096,0,0.03270787000656128,0.01635393500328064,0,-0.09812361001968384,-0.01635393500328064,0,0.09812361001968384,0.01635393500328064,0,-0.06541574001312256,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01635393500328064,0,0.03270787000656128,0.08994664251804352,0,0,-0.00817696750164032,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.01635393500328064,0,-0.13083148002624512,-0.0408848375082016,0,0,0,0,-0.09812361001968384,-0.00817696750164032,0,0.09812361001968384,0.01635393500328064,0,-0.06541574001312256,0,0,0,0.07359270751476288,0,-0.06541574001312256,-0.01635393500328064,0,0.06541574001312256,0.01635393500328064,0,0,-0.03270787000656128,0,0,0.02453090250492096,0,-0.03270787000656128,-0.04906180500984192,0,0.03270787000656128,0.01635393500328064,0,-0.06541574001312256,-0.00817696750164032,0,0.13083148002624512,0,0,-0.03270787000656128,-0.204424187541008,0,0,0,0,-0.03270787000656128,-0.05723877251148224,0,0.03270787000656128,0,0,-0.03270787000656128,-0.00817696750164032,0,0.22895509004592896,0.00817696750164032,0,-0.06541574001312256,-0.01635393500328064,0,0.03270787000656128,0.01635393500328064,0,0,-0.04906180500984192,0,0.06541574001312256,0.04906180500984192,0,-0.03270787000656128,-0.0408848375082016,0,0.03270787000656128,0.02453090250492096,0,0,0,0,0.26166296005249023,0.02453090250492096,0,-0.03270787000656128,0,0,0,0.00817696750164032,0,0,0,0,0.13083148002624512,0,0,-0.06541574001312256,-0.07359270751476288,0,0,0.01635393500328064,0,0,-0.04906180500984192,0,0.19624722003936768,0.04906180500984192,0,-0.09812361001968384,-0.03270787000656128,0,0,0.00817696750164032,0,-0.06541574001312256,-0.03270787000656128,0,0,0.03270787000656128,0,-0.03270787000656128,0,0,0.19624722003936768,0,0,0,-0.01635393500328064,0,0,0.03270787000656128,0,-0.13083148002624512,-0.0408848375082016,0,0.06541574001312256,0.07359270751476288,0,-0.09812361001968384,-0.02453090250492096,0,0,0.00817696750164032,0,-0.06541574001312256,-0.02453090250492096,0,0,0.02453090250492096,0,0,-0.01635393500328064,0,0,0.11447754502296448,0,0,-0.13083148002624512,0,0.22895509004592896,0.01635393500328064,0,-0.03270787000656128,-0.01635393500328064,0,0,0.03270787000656128,0,0,-0.01635393500328064,0,0,0.01635393500328064,0,-0.1635393500328064,-0.00817696750164032,0,0,0.13900844752788544,0,-0.03270787000656128,-0.0408848375082016,0,0.06541574001312256,0.02453090250492096,0,0,-0.01635393500328064,0,0.1635393500328064,0.06541574001312256,0,0,-0.03270787000656128,0,0,0.00817696750164032,0,-0.06541574001312256,0,0,0.03270787000656128,0.09812361001968384,0,-0.13083148002624512,-0.04906180500984192,0,0,0,0,-0.03270787000656128,-0.06541574001312256,0,0,0,0,-0.03270787000656128,-0.0408848375082016,0,0,0.1226545125246048,0,-0.09812361001968384,-0.01635393500328064,0,0,0,0,-0.03270787000656128,-0.0817696750164032,0,0.03270787000656128,0.04906180500984192,0,0,-0.04906180500984192,0,0,0,0,0,-0.0408848375082016,0,0,0.00817696750164032,0,-0.03270787000656128,-0.01635393500328064,0,0.09812361001968384,0.03270787000656128,0,0,-0.00817696750164032,0,0.03270787000656128,0.11447754502296448,0,0,-0.02453090250492096,0,0.03270787000656128,0.00817696750164032,0,0,-0.00817696750164032,0,0,0.05723877251148224,0,-0.03270787000656128,-0.09812361001968384,0,0.06541574001312256,0.00817696750164032,0,0,-0.01635393500328064,0,0,0.04906180500984192,0,0,-0.00817696750164032,0,0.03270787000656128,0.08994664251804352,0,0,0,0,0,0.06541574001312256,0,0,-0.0408848375082016,0,0,0.01635393500328064,0,0,-0.06541574001312256,0,0.06541574001312256,0.03270787000656128,0,-0.03270787000656128,-0.03270787000656128,0,0.03270787000656128,0,0,-0.03270787000656128,-0.01635393500328064,0,0.03270787000656128,0.04906180500984192,0,-0.03270787000656128,-0.07359270751476288,0,0.03270787000656128,0,0,0,-0.03270787000656128,0,0,0.01635393500328064,0,-0.39249444007873535,-0.00817696750164032,0,0,0.04906180500984192,0,-0.06541574001312256,0,0],"text":"<!-- Source: external/zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt#HORIZONTAL-POSITIONING -->\nHORIZONTAL POSITIONING\n\nPositioning in the horizontal direction is more complicated because\n  there are more than, 256 positions.

The X COORDINATE is the HORIZONTAL position across\n  the screen and the Y COORDINATE is the VERTICAL position up and down (see\n  Figure 3-4).\n    To position any sprite on the screen, you must POKE TWO SETTINGS...\n  the X position and the Y position... these tell the computer where to\n  display the UPPER LEFT HAND CORNER of the sprite. Remember that a sprite\n  consists of 504 individual pixels, 24 across by 21 down... so if you POKE\n  a sprite onto the upper left corner of your screen, the sprite will be\n  displayed as a graphic image 24 pixels ACROSS and 21 pixels DOWN starting\n  at the X-Y position you defined. The sprite will be displayed based on\n  the upper left corner of the entire sprite, even if you define the sprite\n  using only a small part of the 24X21-pixel sprite area.\n    To understand how X-Y positioning works, study the following diagram\n  (Figure 3-5), which shows the X and Y numbers in relation to your display\n  screen. Note that the GREY AREA in the diagram shows your television\n  viewing area... the white area represents positions which are OFF your\n  viewing screen...","sourcePath":"external/zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt","sourceMtimeMs":1761327714834,"origin":"external/zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt#POSITIONING-SPRITES-ON-THE-SCREEN"},{"name":"zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt","language":"hardware","vector":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.12995783984661102,0,0,-0.025991566479206085,0,0.05198313295841217,0,0,0,-0.025991566479206085,0,0.1559493988752365,0,0,-0.05198313295841217,0,0,0,0.012995783239603043,0,0,0,0,0,0.03898734971880913,0,0,-0.012995783239603043,0,0,0.025991566479206085,0,-0.10396626591682434,0,0,0.05198313295841217,0,0,-0.05198313295841217,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.025991566479206085,0,0.10396626591682434,0.025991566479206085,0,-0.05198313295841217,-0.03898734971880913,0,0,0.025991566479206085,0,0,-0.07797469943761826,0,0,0.03898734971880913,0,0,0,0,0.05198313295841217,0,0,0,-0.03898734971880913,0,0,0,0,-0.1559493988752365,-0.025991566479206085,0,0.10396626591682434,0,0,0,-0.03898734971880913,0,0.05198313295841217,0,0,-0.05198313295841217,-0.025991566479206085,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.41586506366729736,0,0,-0.05198313295841217,0,0,0,0.025991566479206085,0,0,0,0,0.05198313295841217,0.07797469943761826,0,-0.05198313295841217,-0.025991566479206085,0,0.10396626591682434,0.05198313295841217,0,-0.05198313295841217,0,0,0.311898797750473,0,0,-0.05198313295841217,-0.012995783239603043,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05198313295841217,0,0.05198313295841217,0.025991566479206085,0,0,-0.025991566479206085,0,0,0.012995783239603043,0,-0.10396626591682434,0,0,0.311898797750473,0.06497891992330551,0,-0.10396626591682434,-0.025991566479206085,0,0.05198313295841217,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1559493988752365,0.025991566479206085,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.10396626591682434,0,0.10396626591682434,0.06497891992330551,0,-0.10396626591682434,0,0,0,0.025991566479206085,0,0,-0.03898734971880913,0,0,0,0,0,-0.012995783239603043,0,0.05198313295841217,0.20793253183364868,0,0,-0.03898734971880913,0,0.05198313295841217,0,0,-0.05198313295841217,-0.012995783239603043,0,0,0.025991566479206085,0,0,-0.025991566479206085,0,0,0.05198313295841217,0,0,-0.025991566479206085,0,0,0.16894519329071045,0,-0.10396626591682434,-0.025991566479206085,0,0.10396626591682434,0.03898734971880913,0,-0.1559493988752365,-0.012995783239603043,0,0.10396626591682434,0.025991566479206085,0,-0.10396626591682434,0,0,0.05198313295841217,0,0,0,-0.05198313295841217,0,0,0.1559493988752365,0,-0.05198313295841217,-0.07797469943761826,0,0,0.03898734971880913,0,0,-0.012995783239603043,0,0,0,0,-0.05198313295841217,0,0,0,0.10396626591682434,0,0,-0.012995783239603043,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05198313295841217,0,0,-0.05198313295841217,0,0,0.012995783239603043,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03898734971880913,0,0.20793253183364868,0.05198313295841217,0,0,0,0,0,0.03898734971880913,0,-0.05198313295841217,-0.03898734971880913,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.10396626591682434,0,0,-0.012995783239603043,0,0.05198313295841217,0,0,0,-0.05198313295841217,0,0.05198313295841217,0.06497891992330551,0,0,-0.0909704864025116,0,0,0.07797469943761826,0,0,-0.06497891992330551,0,0,0.10396626591682434,0,0,-0.012995783239603043,0,0,0,0,0,-0.025991566479206085,0,0,0.012995783239603043,0,-0.10396626591682434,0,0,0.05198313295841217,0,0,0,-0.05198313295841217,0,0,0.07797469943761826,0,-0.05198313295841217,-0.025991566479206085,0,0,0.012995783239603043,0,-0.05198313295841217,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05198313295841217,0,0,0,0.03898734971880913,0,-0.05198313295841217,0,0],"text":"<!-- Source: external/zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt#THE-PICTURE-IS-MISSING -->\n[THE PICTURE IS MISSING!]\n\nPROGRAMMING GRAPHICS   157\n~\n\nTo display a sprite in a given location, You must POKE the X and Y\n  settings for each SPRITE... remembering that every sprite has its own\n  unique X POKE and Y POKE.

priority.","sourcePath":"external/zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt","sourceMtimeMs":1761327714834,"origin":"external/zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt#PRIORITY"},{"name":"zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt","language":"hardware","vector":[0.02972458116710186,0.011146718636155128,0,0,-0.04087129980325699,0,0.044586874544620514,0.011146718636155128,0,-0.01486229058355093,-0.05201801657676697,0,0.01486229058355093,0,0,-0.08917374908924103,-0.022293437272310257,0,0.08917374908924103,0,0,-0.02972458116710186,0,0,0,0.09660489112138748,0,-0.01486229058355093,0,0,0,0.02972458116710186,0,0,-0.007431145291775465,0,0,0.011146718636155128,0,-0.05944916233420372,0,0,0.10403603315353394,0.04087129980325699,0,0,-0.01486229058355093,0,0.02972458116710186,0,0,0,-0.026009008288383484,0,0.05944916233420372,0.0037155726458877325,0,-0.02972458116710186,-0.044586874544620514,0,0.07431145757436752,0.007431145291775465,0,0,-0.007431145291775465,0,0.01486229058355093,0.007431145291775465,0,-0.05944916233420372,-0.007431145291775465,0,0,0,0,-0.01486229058355093,-0.04830244556069374,0,0.10403603315353394,0.026009008288383484,0,-0.01486229058355093,-0.007431145291775465,0,0.01486229058355093,0.007431145291775465,0,-0.19320978224277496,-0.06688030809164047,0,0,0.011146718636155128,0,-0.01486229058355093,-0.02972458116710186,0,0,0.01486229058355093,0,0,0,0,0.5053178668022156,0.02972458116710186,0,-0.01486229058355093,-0.03715572878718376,0,0.01486229058355093,0.007431145291775465,0,-0.01486229058355093,-0.09288931638002396,0,0.02972458116710186,0.044586874544620514,0,-0.01486229058355093,-0.01486229058355093,0,0.01486229058355093,0.0037155726458877325,0,-0.01486229058355093,-0.026009008288383484,0,0.17834749817848206,0,0,-0.13376061618328094,0,0,0.01486229058355093,0,0,-0.01486229058355093,-0.02972458116710186,0,0.01486229058355093,0.05573359131813049,0,-0.07431145757436752,0,0,0.13376061618328094,0.01857786439359188,0,-0.02972458116710186,0,0,0.08917374908924103,0.02972458116710186,0,-0.044586874544620514,-0.01486229058355093,0,0.01486229058355093,0.05573359131813049,0,-0.02972458116710186,0,0,0,0.007431145291775465,0,0,-0.04087129980325699,0,0.05944916233420372,0,0,0,-0.026009008288383484,0,0.044586874544620514,0.05201801657676697,0,-0.16348519921302795,-0.011146718636155128,0,0.01486229058355093,0.007431145291775465,0,-0.05944916233420372,-0.10032046586275101,0,0,0,0,-0.08917374908924103,-0.01857786439359188,0,0,0.011146718636155128,0,0,-0.0037155726458877325,0,0.3566949963569641,0.2526589334011078,0,0,-0.03715572878718376,0,0.08917374908924103,0.011146718636155128,0,-0.02972458116710186,-0.022293437272310257,0,0.044586874544620514,0.022293437272310257,0,0,-0.007431145291775465,0,0.01486229058355093,0.01857786439359188,0,-0.05944916233420372,-0.011146718636155128,0,0,0.09288931638002396,0,-0.01486229058355093,-0.08917374908924103,0,0.01486229058355093,0.02972458116710186,0,-0.02972458116710186,-0.01486229058355093,0,0.02972458116710186,0.007431145291775465,0,0,-0.04087129980325699,0,0.02972458116710186,0.06688030809164047,0,0,-0.01486229058355093,0,0,0.044586874544620514,0,-0.10403603315353394,-0.03715572878718376,0,0.01486229058355093,0.033440154045820236,0,0,-0.01486229058355093,0,0.02972458116710186,0.007431145291775465,0,-0.02972458116710186,0,0,0.01486229058355093,0.044586874544620514,0,0,-0.007431145291775465,0,0,0.04087129980325699,0,0,-0.08174259960651398,0,0.02972458116710186,0.011146718636155128,0,-0.11889832466840744,-0.044586874544620514,0,0,0,0,-0.19320978224277496,-0.04830244556069374,0,0,0.026009008288383484,0,0,-0.0037155726458877325,0,0.01486229058355093,0.1820630580186844,0,-0.07431145757436752,-0.04830244556069374,0,0,0.044586874544620514,0,0,-0.01857786439359188,0,0,0.022293437272310257,0,0,0,0,0.01486229058355093,0.13376061618328094,0,0,-0.033440154045820236,0,0.01486229058355093,0.0037155726458877325,0,0,-0.011146718636155128,0,0,0.01486229058355093,0,0,-0.01857786439359188,0,0.07431145757436752,0.01857786439359188,0,0,-0.0037155726458877325,0,0,0.05944916233420372,0,-0.044586874544620514,-0.033440154045820236,0,0,0.0037155726458877325,0,-0.07431145757436752,-0.05573359131813049,0,0,0.011146718636155128,0,-0.01486229058355093,-0.01857786439359188,0,0,0.04830244556069374,0,-0.01486229058355093,-0.022293437272310257,0,0,0.02972458116710186,0,-0.044586874544620514,-0.011146718636155128,0,0.044586874544620514,0.0037155726458877325,0,-0.01486229058355093,-0.007431145291775465,0,0,0.01486229058355093,0,-0.11889832466840744,-0.05944916233420372,0,0.01486229058355093,0.01486229058355093,0,-0.05944916233420372,-0.09660489112138748,0],"text":"<!-- Source: external/zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt#USING-MULTI-COLOR -->\nUSING MULTI-COLOR:\n\nYou can create multi-colored sprites although using multi-color mode\n  requires that you use PAIRS of pixels instead of individual pixels in\n  your sprite picture (in other words each colored \"dot\" or \"block\" in the\n  sprite will consist of two pixels side by side). You have 4 colors to\n  choose from: Sprite Color (chart,above), Multi-Color 1, Multi-Color 2 and\n  \"Background Color\" (background is achieved by using zero settings which\n  let the background color \"show through\"). Consider one horizontal 8-pixel\n  block in a sprite picture. The color of each PAIR of pixels is determined\n  according to whether the left, right, or both pixels are solid, like\n  this:\n\n+-+-+\n  | | | BACKGROUND      (Making BOTH PIXELS BLANK (zero) lets the\n  +-+-+                  INNER SCREEN COLOR (background)show through.)\n\n+-+-+\n  | |@| MULTI-COLOR 1   (Making the RIGHT PIXEL SOLID in a pair of pixels\n  +-+-+                  sets BOTH

filtering. They can be used\n  separately or in combination with one another. Let's go back to the\n  sample program you've been using to play with a simple example that uses\n  a filter. There are several filter controls to set.\n    You add line 15 in the program to set the cutoff frequency of the\n  filter. The cutoff frequency is the reference point for the filter. You\n  SET the high and low frequency cutoff points in registers 21 and 22.

Source: external/zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt#HOW-DO-YOU-WRITE-MACHINE-LANGUAGE-PROGRAMS-2 -->\nThe 64MON cartridge available from your local dealer, is a program that\n  allows you to escape from the world of CBM BASIC, into the land of\n  machine language. It can display the contents of the internal registers\n  in the 6510 microprocessor, and it allows you to display portions of mem-\n  ory, and change them on the screen, using the screen editor. It also has\n  a built-in assembler and disassembler, as well as many other features\n  that allow you to write and edit machine language programs easily. You\n  don't HAVE to use an assembler to write machine language, but the task is\n  considerably easier with it. If you wish to write machine language\n  programs, it is strongly suggested that you purchase an assembler of some\n  sort. Without an assembler you will probably have to \"POKE\" the machine\n  language program into memory, which is totally unadvisable. This manual\n  will give its examples in the format that 64MON uses, from now on. Nearly\n  all assembler formats are the same, therefore the machine language\n  examples shown will almost certainly be compatible with any assembler.\n  But before explaining any of the other features of 64MON, the hexadecimal\n  numbering system must be explained.","sourcePath":"external/zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt","sourceMtimeMs":1761327714834,"origin":"external/zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt#HOW-DO-YOU-WRITE-MACHINE-LANGUAGE-PROGRAMS-2"},{"name":"zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt","language":"hardware","vector":[0,0.02689049020409584,0,0,-0.020167868584394455,0,0.02689049020409584,0.033613111823797226,0,0,-0.08067147433757782,0,0.08067147433757782,0,0,0,-0.02689049020409584,0,0.1344524472951889,0.020167868584394455,0,-0.02689049020409584,-0.01344524510204792,0,0.05378098040819168,0,0,-0.02689049020409584,-0.01344524510204792,0,0,0.0873940959572792,0,-0.02689049020409584,-0.00672262255102396,0,0,0.020167868584394455,0,-0.02689049020409584,-0.01344524510204792,0,0.05378098040819168,0.06722622364759445,0,-0.05378098040819168,-0.01344524510204792,0,0,0.060503602027893066,0,0,-0.02689049020409584,0,0.02689049020409584,0.00672262255102396,0,-0.02689049020409584,-0.00672262255102396,0,0,0,0,0,-0.033613111823797226,0,0,0.02689049020409584,0,0,0,0,0,0.01344524510204792,0,0,-0.04033573716878891,0,0,0.02689049020409584,0,-0.10756196081638336,-0.01344524510204792,0,0.05378098040819168,0,0,-0.16134294867515564,-0.16806556284427643,0,0,0.01344524510204792,0,-0.02689049020409584,-0.04033573716878891,0,0,0.00672262255102396,0,-0.02689049020409584,-0.01344524510204792,0,0.2689048945903778,0.01344524510204792,0,-0.10756196081638336,-0.07394884526729584,0,0.10756196081638336,0.04033573716878891,0,-0.02689049020409584,0,0,0.02689049020409584,0.08067147433757782,0,-0.05378098040819168,-0.020167868584394455,0,0,0.033613111823797226,0,0,-0.047058358788490295,0,0.29579538106918335,0,0,-0.10756196081638336,-0.01344524510204792,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01344524510204792,0,0,0.02689049020409584,0,0,-0.033613111823797226,0,0.02689049020409584,0.00672262255102396,0,-0.05378098040819168,0,0,0.16134294867515564,0.01344524510204792,0,0,-0.01344524510204792,0,0,0.02689049020409584,0,0,0,0,0.02689049020409584,0.02689049020409584,0,-0.02689049020409584,0,0,0,0,0,-0.08067147433757782,0,0,0,0,0,-0.02689049020409584,-0.06722622364759445,0,0.08067147433757782,0.04033573716878891,0,-0.05378098040819168,-0.08067147433757782,0,0,0,0,-0.10756196081638336,-0.02689049020409584,0,0.08067147433757782,0.01344524510204792,0,-0.05378098040819168,-0.01344524510204792,0,0,0.1344524472951889,0,0,-0.12772983312606812,0,0.29579538106918335,0.060503602027893066,0,-0.02689049020409584,-0.033613111823797226,0,0.08067147433757782,0.01344524510204792,0,-0.05378098040819168,-0.02689049020409584,0,0.05378098040819168,0.00672262255102396,0,-0.05378098040819168,0,0,0.02689049020409584,0.16806556284427643,0,-0.10756196081638336,-0.05378098040819168,0,0.02689049020409584,0.033613111823797226,0,-0.02689049020409584,-0.00672262255102396,0,0,0.01344524510204792,0,-0.02689049020409584,-0.00672262255102396,0,0,0.01344524510204792,0,0,-0.033613111823797226,0,0.05378098040819168,0.08067147433757782,0,-0.05378098040819168,-0.00672262255102396,0,0,0.01344524510204792,0,-0.05378098040819168,-0.01344524510204792,0,0,0.01344524510204792,0,-0.08067147433757782,-0.01344524510204792,0,0,0.00672262255102396,0,0,-0.047058358788490295,0,0.02689049020409584,0,0,-0.05378098040819168,-0.01344524510204792,0,0,0.04033573716878891,0,-0.29579538106918335,-0.02689049020409584,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05378098040819168,0,0.05378098040819168,0.04033573716878891,0,-0.02689049020409584,-0.05378098040819168,0,0.02689049020409584,0.01344524510204792,0,-0.1344524472951889,-0.04033573716878891,0,0,0.14789769053459167,0,0,-0.020167868584394455,0,0,0.04033573716878891,0,0,-0.033613111823797226,0,0,0.09411671757698059,0,-0.02689049020409584,-0.05378098040819168,0,0.02689049020409584,0.04033573716878891,0,0,-0.060503602027893066,0,0,0.020167868584394455,0,0,-0.02689049020409584,0,0.10756196081638336,0,0,0,-0.01344524510204792,0,0.10756196081638336,0.07394884526729584,0,0,-0.02689049020409584,0,0,0.02689049020409584,0,0,-0.02689049020409584,0,0,0,0,-0.05378098040819168,-0.02689049020409584,0,0.05378098040819168,0.00672262255102396,0,0,-0.05378098040819168,0,0,0.04033573716878891,0,-0.05378098040819168,0,0,0.05378098040819168,0.01344524510204792,0,0,-0.02689049020409584,0,0,0.00672262255102396,0,-0.29579538106918335,-0.15462031960487366,0,0.02689049020409584,0,0,-0.08067147433757782,-0.020167868584394455,0],"text":"<!-- Source: external/zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt#LDA-LOAD-THE-ACCUMULATOR -->\nLDA - LOAD THE ACCUMULATOR\n\nIn 6510 assembly language, mnemonics are always three characters. LDA\n  represents \"load accumulator with...\", and what the accumulator should be\n  loaded with is decided by the parameter(s) associated with that\n  instruction. The assembler knows which token is represented by each\n  mnemonic, and when it \"assembles\" an instruction, it simply puts into\n  memory (at whatever address has been specified), the token, and what\n  parameters, are given. Some assemblers give error messages, or warnings\n  when you try to assemble something that either the assembler, or the 6510\n  microprocessor, cannot do.\n    If you put a \"#\" symbol in front of the parameter associated with the\n  instruction, this means that you want the register specified in the\n  instruction to be loaded with the \"value\" after the \"#\".

COMMODORE 64, the states of the control lines which select each\n  memory map, and the intended use of each map.\n    The leftmost column of the table contains addresses in hexadecimal\n  notation. The columns aside it introduce all possible memory\n  configurations. The default mode is on the left, and the absolutely most\n  rarely used Ultimax game console configuration is on the right. Each\n  memory configuration column has one or more four-digit binary numbers as\n  a title. The bits, from left to right, represent the state of the /LORAM,\n  /HIRAM, /GAME and /EXROM lines, respectively. The bits whose state does\n  not matter are marked with \"X\".

No arguments need to be set up to use this routine,\n  but both the SETLFS and SETNAM KERNAL routines must be called before\n  using this routine.\n\nHow to Use:\n\n0) Use the SETLFS routine.\n    1) Use the SETNAM routine.\n    2) Call this routine.","sourcePath":"external/zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt","sourceMtimeMs":1761327714834,"origin":"external/zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt#EXAMPLE-2"},{"name":"zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt","language":"hardware","vector":[0,0.004260564222931862,0,0,-0.009941316209733486,0,0.005680752452462912,0.004260564222931862,0,-0.005680752452462912,-0.015622069127857685,0,0.005680752452462912,0.008521128445863724,0,-0.022723009809851646,-0.011361504904925823,0,0.017042256891727448,0.008521128445863724,0,0,-0.001420188113115728,0,0,0.008521128445863724,0,0,-0.005680752452462912,0,0,0.011361504904925823,0,0,-0.008521128445863724,0,0,0.004260564222931862,0,0,-0.001420188113115728,0,0,0,0,-0.011361504904925823,-0.018462445586919785,0,0,0,0,-0.005680752452462912,-0.004260564222931862,0,0.034084513783454895,0.001420188113115728,0,0,-0.009941316209733486,0,0,0,0,0,-0.007100940216332674,0,0,0.005680752452462912,0,-0.011361504904925823,-0.002840376226231456,0,0.005680752452462912,0,0,0,-0.002840376226231456,0,0,0,0,-0.028403760865330696,0,0,0.005680752452462912,0,0,-0.06816902756690979,-0.05396714806556702,0,0.017042256891727448,0.002840376226231456,0,-0.005680752452462912,-0.005680752452462912,0,0,0.004260564222931862,0,0,-0.001420188113115728,0,0.8521128296852112,0.002840376226231456,0,0,-0.005680752452462912,0,0,0.002840376226231456,0,0,-0.022723009809851646,0,0.005680752452462912,0.008521128445863724,0,-0.005680752452462912,-0.001420188113115728,0,0.005680752452462912,0.001420188113115728,0,-0.011361504904925823,-0.005680752452462912,0,0.04544601961970329,0.002840376226231456,0,-0.028403760865330696,-0.001420188113115728,0,0,0.004260564222931862,0,-0.005680752452462912,0,0,0,0.001420188113115728,0,0,-0.008521128445863724,0,0,0.001420188113115728,0,-0.011361504904925823,-0.007100940216332674,0,0.028403760865330696,0.018462445586919785,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.007100940216332674,0,0.022723009809851646,0,0,-0.005680752452462912,-0.007100940216332674,0,0.005680752452462912,0.002840376226231456,0,0,-0.004260564222931862,0,0.017042256891727448,0,0,-0.028403760865330696,-0.017042256891727448,0,0.005680752452462912,0.004260564222931862,0,-0.017042256891727448,-0.03550470247864723,0,0.011361504904925823,0.008521128445863724,0,-0.034084513783454895,-0.002840376226231456,0,0,0,0,-0.005680752452462912,0,0,0.022723009809851646,0.4260564148426056,0,0,-0.02556338533759117,0,0.034084513783454895,0.001420188113115728,0,0,-0.002840376226231456,0,0.005680752452462912,0.002840376226231456,0,-0.005680752452462912,-0.002840376226231456,0,0,0.004260564222931862,0,-0.017042256891727448,-0.007100940216332674,0,0,0.024143196642398834,0,-0.005680752452462912,-0.019882632419466972,0,0.005680752452462912,0.004260564222931862,0,-0.005680752452462912,-0.002840376226231456,0,0,0,0,-0.005680752452462912,0,0,0.011361504904925823,0,0,0,-0.005680752452462912,0,0,0.014201880432665348,0,-0.011361504904925823,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.002840376226231456,0,0,0.011361504904925823,0,-0.011361504904925823,-0.004260564222931862,0,0,0.011361504904925823,0,0,0,0,0.017042256891727448,0.008521128445863724,0,-0.005680752452462912,-0.014201880432665348,0,0,0.002840376226231456,0,-0.011361504904925823,-0.011361504904925823,0,0,0.007100940216332674,0,-0.04544601961970329,-0.017042256891727448,0,0,0,0,-0.005680752452462912,-0.009941316209733486,0,0.005680752452462912,0.012781692668795586,0,-0.022723009809851646,-0.017042256891727448,0,0.011361504904925823,0.02130282111465931,0,-0.005680752452462912,-0.001420188113115728,0,0.017042256891727448,0.002840376226231456,0,0,-0.002840376226231456,0,0.005680752452462912,0.2130282074213028,0,-0.011361504904925823,-0.008521128445863724,0,0.005680752452462912,0,0,-0.017042256891727448,-0.002840376226231456,0,0.005680752452462912,0.004260564222931862,0,0,-0.004260564222931862,0,0,0.001420188113115728,0,-0.028403760865330696,-0.005680752452462912,0,0,0.017042256891727448,0,-0.005680752452462912,-0.007100940216332674,0,0,0,0,-0.017042256891727448,-0.007100940216332674,0,0,0,0,-0.011361504904925823,0,0,0.005680752452462912,0,0,-0.005680752452462912,-0.008521128445863724,0,0,0.007100940216332674,0,0,0,0,0,0.008521128445863724,0,0,-0.002840376226231456,0,0,0.005680752452462912,0,-0.10225354135036469,-0.007100940216332674,0,0.005680752452462912,0.001420188113115728,0,-0.011361504904925823,-0.022723009809851646,0],"text":"<!-- Source: external/zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt#EXAMPLE-2 -->\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\n  | NOTE: Device 0 (the keyboard), device 2 (RS-232), and device 3 (the   |\n  | screen) cannot be SAVEd to.

Source: external/zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt#OUTPUT-TO-MODEM-2 -->\nMost computers use the American Standard Code for Information In-\n  terchange, known as ASCII (pronounced ASK-KEY). This standard set of\n  character codes is somewhat different from the codes used in the Com-\n  modore 64. When communicating with other computers, the Commodore\n  character codes must be translated into their ASCII counterparts. A table\n  of standard ASCII codes is included in this book in Appendix C.\n    Output to the modem is a fairly uncomplicated task, aside from the need\n  for character translation. However, you must know the receiving device\n  fairly well, especially when writing programs where your computer \"talks\"\n  to another computer without human intervention. An example of this would\n  be a terminal program that automatically types in your account number and\n  secret password. To do this successfully, you must carefully count the\n  number of characters and RETURN characters. Otherwise, the computer\n  receiving the characters won't know what to do with them.","sourcePath":"external/zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt","sourceMtimeMs":1761327714834,"origin":"external/zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt#OUTPUT-TO-MODEM-2"},{"name":"zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt","language":"hardware","vector":[0.0301229078322649,0.03765363246202469,0,0,-0.07530726492404938,0,0.09036872535943985,0.022592181339859962,0,-0.0301229078322649,0,0,0.0301229078322649,0,0,-0.15061452984809875,-0.022592181339859962,0,0.0301229078322649,0,0,-0.0301229078322649,-0.007530726958066225,0,0,0.007530726958066225,0,-0.0301229078322649,-0.01506145391613245,0,0,0.06777653843164444,0,-0.0602458156645298,-0.01506145391613245,0,0.15061452984809875,0.0301229078322649,0,0,-0.007530726958066225,0,0.1204916313290596,0.0301229078322649,0,-0.0602458156645298,-0.0301229078322649,0,0.0602458156645298,0,0,-0.0602458156645298,-0.022592181339859962,0,0.09036872535943985,0.007530726958066225,0,0,-0.007530726958066225,0,0.0301229078322649,0.022592181339859962,0,-0.0301229078322649,-0.0301229078322649,0,0,0.022592181339859962,0,0,-0.01506145391613245,0,0.0301229078322649,0,0,-0.0301229078322649,-0.045184362679719925,0,0.0602458156645298,0.01506145391613245,0,-0.0602458156645298,-0.0301229078322649,0,0.0301229078322649,0.007530726958066225,0,-0.1807374507188797,-0.1807374507188797,0,0.0301229078322649,0.01506145391613245,0,-0.0602458156645298,-0.06777653843164444,0,0,0.01506145391613245,0,0,-0.01506145391613245,0,0.27110615372657776,0.045184362679719925,0,0,-0.01506145391613245,0,0.0301229078322649,0.022592181339859962,0,-0.0602458156645298,-0.09789945185184479,0,0.0301229078322649,0.0301229078322649,0,-0.1204916313290596,-0.03765363246202469,0,0.0301229078322649,0.007530726958066225,0,0,-0.01506145391613245,0,0.3012290596961975,0,0,-0.15061452984809875,-0.0301229078322649,0,0,0.07530726492404938,0,0,0,0,0,0.0602458156645298,0,0,-0.03765363246202469,0,0,0.03765363246202469,0,0,-0.03765363246202469,0,0.2409832626581192,0.05271508917212486,0,-0.0602458156645298,0,0,0,0.0301229078322649,0,-0.0602458156645298,-0.01506145391613245,0,0.0301229078322649,0,0,-0.0301229078322649,-0.007530726958066225,0,0.09036872535943985,0.01506145391613245,0,0,-0.01506145391613245,0,0.0301229078322649,0.03765363246202469,0,-0.1204916313290596,-0.045184362679719925,0,0.0301229078322649,0.022592181339859962,0,0,-0.09789945185184479,0,0,0.01506145391613245,0,-0.09036872535943985,-0.045184362679719925,0,0,0.007530726958066225,0,-0.0301229078322649,-0.01506145391613245,0,0.0301229078322649,0.13555307686328888,0,0,-0.08283799886703491,0,0.21086035668849945,0.022592181339859962,0,0,-0.045184362679719925,0,0.0602458156645298,0.022592181339859962,0,-0.0301229078322649,-0.0602458156645298,0,0,0.03765363246202469,0,-0.1204916313290596,-0.007530726958066225,0,0,0.1581452637910843,0,-0.0301229078322649,-0.11296090483665466,0,0.0301229078322649,0.007530726958066225,0,-0.0301229078322649,-0.007530726958066225,0,0.0301229078322649,0,0,0,-0.007530726958066225,0,0.0301229078322649,0,0,0,-0.01506145391613245,0,0,0.1581452637910843,0,-0.0602458156645298,-0.0301229078322649,0,0,0.0301229078322649,0,0,-0.045184362679719925,0,0.0301229078322649,0.0301229078322649,0,-0.0602458156645298,-0.0301229078322649,0,0,0.06777653843164444,0,-0.15061452984809875,0,0,0,0.022592181339859962,0,-0.0602458156645298,-0.06777653843164444,0,0,0.01506145391613245,0,0,0,0,0.0301229078322649,0.007530726958066225,0,-0.09036872535943985,-0.05271508917212486,0,0.0602458156645298,0.01506145391613245,0,-0.09036872535943985,-0.0301229078322649,0,0.0301229078322649,0.022592181339859962,0,0,-0.045184362679719925,0,0,0.11296090483665466,0,0,-0.01506145391613245,0,0,0.0301229078322649,0,0,-0.01506145391613245,0,0,0.06777653843164444,0,-0.0301229078322649,-0.0602458156645298,0,0.0301229078322649,0.007530726958066225,0,-0.0301229078322649,-0.0301229078322649,0,0.0301229078322649,0.022592181339859962,0,0,-0.045184362679719925,0,0.0602458156645298,0.022592181339859962,0,0,0,0,0,0.09036872535943985,0,-0.0301229078322649,-0.03765363246202469,0,0,0,0,0,-0.0301229078322649,0,0.0301229078322649,0,0,-0.0602458156645298,0,0,0.0301229078322649,0.01506145391613245,0,-0.0301229078322649,-0.0301229078322649,0,0,0.0602458156645298,0,-0.0602458156645298,-0.09036872535943985,0,0.0301229078322649,0,0,-0.0602458156645298,-0.045184362679719925,0,0,0.007530726958066225,0,-0.33135199546813965,-0.007530726958066225,0,0.0301229078322649,0.03765363246202469,0,-0.0602458156645298,-0.045184362679719925,0],"text":"<!-- Source: external/zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt#LIGHT-PEN -->\nLIGHT PEN\n\nThe light pen input latches the current screen position into a pair of\n  registers (LPX, LPY) on a low-going edge. The X position register 19\n  ($13) will contain the 8 MSB of the X position at the time of transition.\n  Since the X position is defined by a 512-state counter (9 bits),\n  resolution to 2 horizontal dots is provided. Similarly, the Y position is\n  latched in its register 20 ($14), but here 8 bits provide single raster\n  resolution within the visible display. The light pen latch may be\n  triggered only once per frame, and subsequent triggers within the same\n  frame will have no effect. Therefore, you must take several samples\n  before turning the pen to the screen (3 or more samples average),\n  depending upon the characteristics of your light pen.","sourcePath":"external/zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt","sourceMtimeMs":1761327714834,"origin":"external/zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt#LIGHT-PEN"},{"name":"zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt","language":"hardware","vector":[0.005755109712481499,0,0,0,-0.011510219424962997,0,0.017265329137444496,0.005755109712481499,0,-0.017265329137444496,-0.0014387774281203747,0,0.005755109712481499,0.0028775548562407494,0,-0.005755109712481499,-0.011510219424962997,0,0.017265329137444496,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.008632664568722248,0,0,0,0,0.011510219424962997,0.004316332284361124,0,0,-0.0028775548562407494,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.005755109712481499,0.0028775548562407494,0,0,-0.005755109712481499,0,0,0.004316332284361124,0,0,-0.004316332284361124,0,0.005755109712481499,0,0,0,0,0,0.005755109712481499,0.007193887140601873,0,0,-0.005755109712481499,0,0,0.005755109712481499,0,-0.011510219424962997,0,0,0,0.0014387774281203747,0,0,-0.007193887140601873,0,0.005755109712481499,0.008632664568722248,0,-0.017265329137444496,-0.0028775548562407494,0,0.005755109712481499,0,0,-0.023020438849925995,-0.015826551243662834,0,0,0.0028775548562407494,0,-0.005755109712481499,-0.007193887140601873,0,0,0.0028775548562407494,0,0,-0.0028775548562407494,0,0.8632664680480957,0.008632664568722248,0,-0.005755109712481499,-0.008632664568722248,0,0.011510219424962997,0.0028775548562407494,0,0,-0.02014288492500782,0,0.005755109712481499,0.008632664568722248,0,-0.011510219424962997,-0.0028775548562407494,0,0,0.0014387774281203747,0,0,0,0,0.03453065827488899,0.007193887140601873,0,-0.017265329137444496,-0.0014387774281203747,0,0.011510219424962997,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.004316332284361124,0,0,0,0,0,0.0014387774281203747,0,-0.005755109712481499,-0.0014387774281203747,0,0.028775548562407494,0.0028775548562407494,0,0,0,0,0.011510219424962997,0.004316332284361124,0,-0.005755109712481499,0,0,0.005755109712481499,0.0014387774281203747,0,0,-0.007193887140601873,0,0,0,0,-0.005755109712481499,0,0,0,0.005755109712481499,0,-0.023020438849925995,-0.01007144246250391,0,0.011510219424962997,0.005755109712481499,0,-0.005755109712481499,-0.011510219424962997,0,0,0,0,-0.03453065827488899,-0.005755109712481499,0,0,0.004316332284361124,0,0,-0.0014387774281203747,0,0.023020438849925995,0.43163323402404785,0,0,-0.01007144246250391,0,0.005755109712481499,0.007193887140601873,0,0,-0.0014387774281203747,0,0,0.004316332284361124,0,0,-0.005755109712481499,0,0,0.004316332284361124,0,-0.023020438849925995,-0.004316332284361124,0,0.005755109712481499,0.018704107031226158,0,-0.005755109712481499,-0.01007144246250391,0,0,0.01007144246250391,0,0,0,0,0.005755109712481499,0,0,-0.011510219424962997,0,0,0,0.0028775548562407494,0,0,-0.0028775548562407494,0,0.005755109712481499,0.014387774281203747,0,-0.005755109712481499,0,0,0,0.007193887140601873,0,0,-0.0028775548562407494,0,0,0.0028775548562407494,0,-0.005755109712481499,0,0,0,0.0014387774281203747,0,-0.017265329137444496,-0.0028775548562407494,0,0,0.0014387774281203747,0,-0.011510219424962997,-0.011510219424962997,0,0,0.005755109712481499,0,0,-0.005755109712481499,0,0,0,0,-0.06906131654977798,-0.017265329137444496,0,0,0.0014387774281203747,0,-0.011510219424962997,-0.004316332284361124,0,0.005755109712481499,0.01294899731874466,0,0,-0.005755109712481499,0,0.005755109712481499,0.0028775548562407494,0,-0.005755109712481499,-0.0014387774281203747,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.005755109712481499,0.21581661701202393,0,0,-0.01294899731874466,0,0.005755109712481499,0.005755109712481499,0,-0.005755109712481499,-0.0028775548562407494,0,0,0.0014387774281203747,0,0,-0.0028775548562407494,0,0.005755109712481499,0.0028775548562407494,0,0,-0.005755109712481499,0,0.005755109712481499,0.008632664568722248,0,-0.005755109712481499,-0.004316332284361124,0,0,0.005755109712481499,0,0,-0.0028775548562407494,0,0.011510219424962997,0,0,-0.005755109712481499,0,0,0.011510219424962997,0,0,0,-0.004316332284361124,0,0,0.007193887140601873,0,-0.011510219424962997,-0.008632664568722248,0,0.017265329137444496,0.0028775548562407494,0,-0.005755109712481499,-0.007193887140601873,0,0,0.0014387774281203747,0,-0.028775548562407494,0,0,0.005755109712481499,0,0,-0.005755109712481499,-0.035969436168670654,0],"text":"<!-- Source: external/zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt#KERNAL-ENTRY -->\nKERNAL ENTRY:\n\nOPEN ($FFC0) (See KERNAL specifications for more information on entry\n  conditions and instructions.)\n\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\n  | IMPORTANT NOTE: In a BASIC program, the RS-232 OPEN command should be |\n  | performed before creating any variables or arrays because an automatic|\n  | CLR is performed when an RS-232 channel is OPENed (This is due to the |\n  | allocation of 512 bytes at the top of memory.)

1,22,A,Z are connected to the system ground.\n    Pin 6 is the DOT CLOCK. This is the 8.18-MHz video dot clock. All\n  system timing is derived from this clock.\n    Pin 12 is the BA (BUS AVAILABLE) signal from the VIC-II chip. This line\n  will go low 3 cycles before the VIC-II takes over the system busses, and\n  remains low until the VIC-II is finished fetching display information.\n    Pin 13 is the DMA (DIRECT MEMORY ACCESS) line. When this line is pulled\n  low, the address bus, the data bus, and the Read/Write line of the 6510\n  processor chip enter high-impedance state mode. This allows an external\n  processor to take control of the system busses. This line should only be\n  pulled low when the (02 clock is low.

The sound can be\n  sustained for any length of time and terminated by clearing the Gate bit.\n  Each voice can be used separately, with independent parameters and\n  gating, or in unison to create a single, powerful voice. When used in\n  unison, a slight detuning of each oscillator or tuning to musical\n  intervals creates a rich, animated sound.","sourcePath":"external/zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt","sourceMtimeMs":1761327714834,"origin":"external/zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt#VOICE-3"},{"name":"zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt","language":"hardware","vector":[0,0.027240103110671043,0,0,-0.027240103110671043,0,0.10896041244268417,0.00908003468066454,0,0,0,0,0.03632013872265816,0.01816006936132908,0,-0.21792082488536835,-0.06356023997068405,0,0.03632013872265816,0.03632013872265816,0,-0.03632013872265816,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03632013872265816,0.06356023997068405,0,-0.07264027744531631,-0.01816006936132908,0,0.03632013872265816,0.07264027744531631,0,-0.07264027744531631,-0.01816006936132908,0,0.07264027744531631,0.04540017247200012,0,0,-0.00908003468066454,0,0,0,0,0,-0.00908003468066454,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03632013872265816,0,0,-0.01816006936132908,0,0.10896041244268417,0.01816006936132908,0,0,0,0,0.07264027744531631,0.05448020622134209,0,0,-0.01816006936132908,0,0,0.00908003468066454,0,-0.07264027744531631,-0.03632013872265816,0,0.03632013872265816,0,0,-0.03632013872265816,-0.1816006898880005,0,0.03632013872265816,0.027240103110671043,0,-0.07264027744531631,-0.04540017247200012,0,0,0.01816006936132908,0,0,-0.027240103110671043,0,0.29056110978126526,0.05448020622134209,0,0,-0.01816006936132908,0,0.03632013872265816,0.027240103110671043,0,-0.07264027744531631,-0.10896041244268417,0,0.03632013872265816,0.027240103110671043,0,-0.07264027744531631,-0.01816006936132908,0,0.03632013872265816,0,0,0,0,0,0.3268812298774719,0.027240103110671043,0,-0.14528055489063263,-0.04540017247200012,0,0,0.027240103110671043,0,-0.03632013872265816,-0.03632013872265816,0,0.03632013872265816,0.03632013872265816,0,0,0,0,0,0.00908003468066454,0,-0.03632013872265816,0,0,0.1816006898880005,0.03632013872265816,0,-0.03632013872265816,0,0,0,0.01816006936132908,0,-0.1816006898880005,0,0,0,0.05448020622134209,0,-0.03632013872265816,0,0,0.03632013872265816,0.03632013872265816,0,0,0,0,0.03632013872265816,0.01816006936132908,0,-0.10896041244268417,-0.04540017247200012,0,0.03632013872265816,0.027240103110671043,0,0,-0.01816006936132908,0,0,0.04540017247200012,0,-0.1816006898880005,-0.03632013872265816,0,0.07264027744531631,0,0,0,-0.01816006936132908,0,0,0.14528055489063263,0,0,-0.08172030746936798,0,0.1816006898880005,0.027240103110671043,0,-0.07264027744531631,-0.05448020622134209,0,0,0.01816006936132908,0,-0.07264027744531631,-0.03632013872265816,0,0.03632013872265816,0.04540017247200012,0,-0.03632013872265816,0,0,0,0.17252065241336823,0,-0.03632013872265816,-0.1271204799413681,0,0,0.00908003468066454,0,0,-0.027240103110671043,0,0,0.01816006936132908,0,0,0,0,0,0.00908003468066454,0,0,-0.03632013872265816,0,0,0.09988038241863251,0,-0.07264027744531631,-0.03632013872265816,0,0.03632013872265816,0.01816006936132908,0,0,-0.09080034494400024,0,0,0,0,-0.07264027744531631,-0.01816006936132908,0,0.03632013872265816,0.01816006936132908,0,-0.03632013872265816,0,0,0.07264027744531631,0.01816006936132908,0,-0.10896041244268417,-0.05448020622134209,0,0,0.04540017247200012,0,-0.07264027744531631,0,0,0.03632013872265816,0.01816006936132908,0,0,-0.09080034494400024,0,0.03632013872265816,0.03632013872265816,0,0,-0.01816006936132908,0,0,0.00908003468066454,0,0,-0.00908003468066454,0,0.03632013872265816,0.09988038241863251,0,-0.03632013872265816,-0.05448020622134209,0,0.03632013872265816,0,0,0,-0.03632013872265816,0,0,0.09080034494400024,0,0,-0.01816006936132908,0,0.03632013872265816,0.00908003468066454,0,0,-0.03632013872265816,0,0.14528055489063263,0.00908003468066454,0,0,-0.01816006936132908,0,0.07264027744531631,0.00908003468066454,0,0,0,0,0,0.08172030746936798,0,0,-0.03632013872265816,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04540017247200012,0,0.07264027744531631,0.027240103110671043,0,-0.03632013872265816,0,0,0.03632013872265816,0,0,0,-0.04540017247200012,0,0.10896041244268417,0.06356023997068405,0,0,-0.027240103110671043,0,0,0.03632013872265816,0,-0.07264027744531631,-0.09988038241863251,0,0,0,0,-0.3268812298774719,-0.04540017247200012,0,0.03632013872265816,0.027240103110671043,0,-0.07264027744531631,0,0],"text":"<!-- Source: external/zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/c64prg.txt#MISCELLANEOUS-3 -->\nAPPENDIX O   469\n~\n\nENV 3 (Register $1C)\n\nSame as OSC 3, but this register allows the microprocessor to read the\n  output of the Voice 3 Envelope Generator.

The output pulse\nwidth is determined by the size of R34 and C24. Pulse width = 1.1 x R34 x\nC24 = .5 seconds. The output on pin 9 is \"high\" active. The output of U8 is\n\"low\" active. Reset initializes all the processor logic and causes the\nprocessor to load the program counter register with the address of the\nfirst instruction of the operating system program called the KERNAL. The\nstarting address is stored in locations $FFFC and $FFFD. The first\ninstruction is decode and executed giving KERNAL control of the computer\noperations. The reset pulse occurs when turning the power on to the\ncomputer.\n\n5\n~\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tC64 CIRCUIT THEORY\n\n[Figure: Clock circuit schematic]\n\nThe C64 Clock Circuits.","sourcePath":"external/zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/C64ServiceManual.txt","sourceMtimeMs":1761327823504,"origin":"external/zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/C64ServiceManual.txt#PARTS-LIST-C-64-3"},{"name":"zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/C64ServiceManual.txt","language":"hardware","vector":[0.036220237612724304,0.036220237612724304,0,0,-0.009055059403181076,0,0.10866071283817291,0.009055059403181076,0,0,-0.04527529701590538,0,0.07244047522544861,0.027165178209543228,0,-0.036220237612724304,-0.027165178209543228,0,0.036220237612724304,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07244047522544861,-0.054330356419086456,0,0.036220237612724304,0.018110118806362152,0,0,-0.018110118806362152,0,0,0,0,0,-0.054330356419086456,0,0.036220237612724304,0,0,0,-0.009055059403181076,0,0.036220237612724304,0,0,0,-0.018110118806362152,0,0,0,0,0,-0.018110118806362152,0,0,0.018110118806362152,0,0,-0.027165178209543228,0,0,0,0,-0.036220237612724304,-0.036220237612724304,0,0,0.018110118806362152,0,0,-0.036220237612724304,0,0,0.036220237612724304,0,-0.10866071283817291,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07244047522544861,-0.06338541209697723,0,0,0,0,-0.036220237612724304,-0.027165178209543228,0,0.036220237612724304,0.018110118806362152,0,0,0,0,0.6881844997406006,0.06338541209697723,0,-0.10866071283817291,0,0,0.036220237612724304,0.054330356419086456,0,0,-0.027165178209543228,0,0.036220237612724304,0.036220237612724304,0,-0.036220237612724304,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04527529701590538,0,0.25354164838790894,0.027165178209543228,0,-0.036220237612724304,-0.009055059403181076,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.018110118806362152,0,0,-0.027165178209543228,0,0,0.027165178209543228,0,0,-0.009055059403181076,0,0.18110118806362152,0,0,0,-0.027165178209543228,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.018110118806362152,0,0,0,0,-0.036220237612724304,-0.009055059403181076,0,0,0.009055059403181076,0,-0.036220237612724304,-0.06338541209697723,0,0.036220237612724304,0,0,-0.10866071283817291,-0.054330356419086456,0,0.036220237612724304,0.009055059403181076,0,-0.036220237612724304,-0.036220237612724304,0,0,0.036220237612724304,0,0,0,0,0,0.3440922498703003,0,0,-0.08149553090333939,0,0,0.018110118806362152,0,0,-0.009055059403181076,0,0,0.027165178209543228,0,0,-0.018110118806362152,0,0,0.027165178209543228,0,-0.036220237612724304,0,0,0,0.14488095045089722,0,-0.07244047522544861,-0.027165178209543228,0,0,0.009055059403181076,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.036220237612724304,-0.018110118806362152,0,0,0.009055059403181076,0,0,0,0,0,0.09055059403181076,0,0,0,0,0,0.009055059403181076,0,0,0,0,0,0.009055059403181076,0,-0.036220237612724304,0,0,0,0,0,-0.036220237612724304,-0.018110118806362152,0,0,0,0,0,-0.018110118806362152,0,0.036220237612724304,0.018110118806362152,0,0,-0.06338541209697723,0,0.07244047522544861,0.018110118806362152,0,-0.036220237612724304,-0.018110118806362152,0,0.07244047522544861,0,0,0,-0.027165178209543228,0,0,0,0,-0.036220237612724304,-0.018110118806362152,0,0.036220237612724304,0,0,-0.036220237612724304,-0.009055059403181076,0,0,0.009055059403181076,0,0,0,0,0,0.17204612493515015,0,-0.10866071283817291,-0.04527529701590538,0,0.036220237612724304,0.009055059403181076,0,-0.036220237612724304,-0.036220237612724304,0,0,0.009055059403181076,0,-0.10866071283817291,-0.009055059403181076,0,0,0,0,0,-0.018110118806362152,0,0,0.06338541209697723,0,0,-0.009055059403181076,0,0,0,0,-0.036220237612724304,0,0,0.036220237612724304,0,0,-0.036220237612724304,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07244047522544861,-0.018110118806362152,0,0.036220237612724304,0.04527529701590538,0,-0.07244047522544861,-0.018110118806362152,0,0.07244047522544861,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.018110118806362152,0,-0.10866071283817291,0,0,0,0.036220237612724304,0,-0.036220237612724304,-0.027165178209543228,0],"text":"<!-- Source: external/zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/C64ServiceManual.txt#8-Pin-Video-and-Audio-Output-Circuits-Refer-to-schematic-214-5 -->\nParallel port B of U2 (PB0 - PB7) is made available on the user port.\nParallel data transfers with external device are made very easily through\nthis parallel port.

Introduction\n---------------\n\nThis paper is an attempt to summarize the results of various people's\nexaminations of the graphics chip \"6567/6569 Video Interface Controller\n(VIC-II)\" (simply called \"VIC\" in the following) used in the legendary\nCommodore 64, and to provide a complete reference to its specified and\nunspecified properties. It is primarily intended for C64 programmers and\nauthors of C64 emulators, but should also be interesting to \"outsiders\"\ninterested in hardware design and programming and hacking a computer up to\nthe last bits. For this purpose, some general information (e.g. the C64\nmemory map) already known to experienced C64 programmers has been included\nas well.\n\nThe description of the unspecified properties is based on tests done by\nMarko M�kel�, Andreas Boose, Pasi Ojala, Wolfgang Lorenz and myself (not to\nmention numerous others) during the last years. It also covers internal\nregisters and workings of the VIC. As no schematics of the VIC are\navailable it can of course only be speculative, but in all cases a model\nhas been chosen that explains the observed phenomena with the minimally\nrequired circuitry. E.g. for the video matrix counter (VC), a model with\ntwo simple counters was given preference to a more elaborate one with a +40\nadder.\n\nAlthough some measurements have been done with an

Source: external/zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/c64/vic-ii.txt#Page-1-5 -->\nThe 656* series graphics chip by MOS Technologies were originally designed\nto be used in video games and graphics terminals. But as the sales in these\nmarkets have been rather poor, Commodore decided to use the chips when they\nwere planning to make their own home computers.\n\nIn the C64, the \"Video Interface Controller II (VIC-II)\" [2] has been used,\nfeaturing 3 text based (40x25 characters with 8x8 pixels each) and 2 bitmap\nbased (320x200 pixels) video modes, 8 hardware sprites and a fixed palette\nof 16 colors. It can manage up to 16KB of dynamic RAM (including the\ngeneration of RAS and CAS and the RAM refresh) and also has a light pen\ninput and interrupt possibilities.\n\nTwo VIC types appear in the C64: The 6567 in NTSC machines and the 6569 in\nPAL machines. There are several mask steppings of both types, but the\ndifferences are mostly neglectable with the exception of the 6567R56A.\nNewer C64 versions are bearing the functionally equivalent chips 8562\n(NTSC) and 8565 (PAL). In the following, only 6567/6569 will be mentioned,\nbut all statements are applicable for the 856* chips.

With the aid\nof a special PAL chip in the C64, many different memory configurations can\nbe used via the 6510 I/O port lines and control lines on the expansion\nport (see [3]).

stands for the VIC, \"P\" for\nthe 6510. The cycles designated with \"p\" are accesses of the 6510 that are\nonly performed if they are write accesses. The first \"p\" read access stops\nthe 6510, at least after the third \"p\" as the 6510 never does more than 3\nwrite accesses in succession. On a \"p\" read access the processor addresses\nare still output on the bus because AEC is still high.\n\nThe diagram describes the normal process of a bus take-over. By\nappropriately modifying the VIC register $d011, it is possible to force a\nbus take-over at extraordinary times. This is explained in chapter 3 as\nwell as the complete bus timing of a VIC raster line.\n\n3. Description of the VIC\n-------------------------\n\nThis chapter is about the single function units in the VIC, their way of\nworking and their unspecified behavior, and the insights into the internal\nfunctions of the VIC that can be gained by that.\n\n3.1.
