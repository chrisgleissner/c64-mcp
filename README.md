Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for driving a Commodore 64 via the official REST API of either the [Commodore 64 Ultimate](https://www.commodore.net/) or [Ultimate 64](https://ultimate64.com/).

It exposes a focused tool surface that lets LLM agents or automation scripts upload and run BASIC or assembly programs on the C64, read or write its RAM, control the VIC or SID, print documents, or perform a reset.

## Highlights ‚ú®

- **Code** with AI support in Basic or Assembly on a C64.
- **Compose** music or create images on a C64 using AI.
- **Custom Knowledge Base**: Built-in local [RAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation) for Commodore 64 BASIC and 6502 assembly examples (no external services).
- **Offline-ready** npm package: The published npm artifact includes all necessary docs and RAG embeddings. After `npm install c64-mcp`, the server runs locally without network access to fetch docs or embeddings, e.g. for use with a locally started [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama)-based LLM.
- **Configurable** via `~/.c64mcp.json` (or `C64MCP_CONFIG`) to point to your C64's host name or IP address.
- **TypeScript** ESM modules throughout: `ts-node` powers the local development flow and exposes a Fastify-based MCP server running on your local machine on port 8000.


## Example üé¨

Let's compose a children song on the C64 using ChatGPT 5 and Visual Code.

1. We type the prompt:
`play a children song on the c64`.
1. ChatGPT reads our prompt and creates a song. In this case it creates a Basic program that plays a song, but direct SID creation is work in progress.
1. The LLM then uses this MCP to transfer the Basic program to the Ultimate 64 and play it.

The following image shows the final output, using the [C64 Stream](https://github.com/chrisgleissner/c64stream/) OBS plugin to capture the C64 video and audio output:

![duck song](./doc/img/prompts/duck_song.png)

1. After the follow-up prompt `Now create a PETSCII image related to that song` the following image of ducks swimming on a pond appears:

![duck petscii](./doc/img/prompts/duck_petscii.png)

...and our C64 is now AI-powered!

## Installation üì¶

The installation consists of two steps: Installing Node.js and then installing and running the MCP server.

### Install Node.js

Requires Node.js 18+ (20+ recommended) and npm.

- Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install -y curl ca-certificates
  # Option A: distro packages (may be older)
  sudo apt install -y nodejs npm
  # Option B (recommended): NodeSource LTS (20.x)
  curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
  sudo apt install -y nodejs
  ```

- macOS

  ```bash
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" # if Homebrew not installed
  brew install node@20
  brew link --overwrite node@20
  ```

- Windows

  ```powershell
  # Option A: winget (Windows 10/11)
  winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS
  # Option B: Chocolatey
  choco install nodejs-lts -y
  ```

Verify:

```bash
node --version  # v18+ (v20+ recommended)

```

### Install and Run the MCP Server

You have three options to install and run the MCP server: quick start with npx, persistent install via npm, or install from source via GitHub.

For a quick start, the first option is recommended. If you plan to contribute code or run tests, use the third option.

#### Quick start (npx, zero-setup)

Run the prebuilt server without creating a project. npx downloads the package and expands all bundled files on disk for this session.

```bash
HOST=127.0.0.1 PORT=8000 npx -y c64-mcp@latest
```

By default, the MCP server assumes the C64's host name is `c64u`. To change this, create `~/.c64mcp.json`:

```json
{ 
  "c64_host": "<Hostname or IP of C64>" 
}
```

#### Persistent install (npm)

This installs the prebuilt `c64-mcp` Node package from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/c64-mcp) and then runs the server. No build step required.

1. Create a folder (or use an existing project) and install the package:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/c64-mcp && cd ~/c64-mcp
npm init -y
npm install c64-mcp
```

1. Configure your C64 target (optional but recommended):

Create `~/.c64mcp.json` with your device host/IP:

```json
{ "c64_host": "c64u" }
```

1. Start the server:

```bash
HOST=127.0.0.1 PORT=8000 node ./node_modules/c64-mcp/dist/index.js
```

Notes

- Works fully offline. The npm package bundles `doc/`, `data/`, `mcp.json`, and `mcp-manifest.json`.
- All environment flags (e.g., `RAG_BUILD_ON_START=1`) apply the same as in a source checkout.
- Using npx or a local install both place the package contents on the filesystem in expanded form.

#### Install from source (GitHub)

Use this path if you plan to run tests or contribute code; it runs the TypeScript sources directly.

1. Clone and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chrisgleissner/c64-mcp.git
cd c64-mcp
npm install
```

1. Start the development server

```bash
npm start
```

The dev server runs via ts-node; for a quick type check and manifest generation, you can also run:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Health Check

When your MCP server starts, it tries to connect to your C64 device and logs success or failure.

A healthy start looks like this:

```sh
> c64-mcp@0.2.1 start
> node --import ./scripts/register-ts-node.mjs src/index.ts

{"level":30,"time":1761206855279,"pid":43066,"hostname":"mickey","status":200,"msg":"Connectivity check succeeded for c64 device at http://192.168.1.64"}

...skipped...

{"level":30,"time":1761206855344,"pid":43066,"hostname":"mickey","msg":"c64-mcp server listening on 127.0.0.1:8000"}
```

Once running, verify that the MCP server can reach your C64 device by querying the version endpoint:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8000/tools/version | jq
```

You should see the version of the REST API repoted back by your C64 and relayed to you via the MCP server:

```json
{
  "details": {
    "version": "0.1",
    "errors": []
  }
}
```

Congratulations! You are now all set to use the MCP server with your C64 device.


## Documentation üìö

The Agent has two main artifacts:

- [`mcp.json`](mcp.json):  human-maintained project configuration (entry point, env vars, metadata).
- [`mcp-manifest.json`](mcp-manifest.json): auto-generated tool manifest consumed by MCP clients. It is regenerated via `npm run manifest` or `npm run build`. Avoid editing the generated manifest by hand.

Besides this `README.md` document, the project includes extensive documentation:

- [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) ‚Äî Quick-start guidance for automation agents and persona definitions.
- [`doc/context/bootstrap.md`](doc/context/bootstrap.md) ‚Äî Core primer injected ahead of agent prompts.
- `.github/prompts/*.prompt.md` ‚Äî Request templates surfaced to agents (see `src/context.ts`).
- [`doc/developer.md`](doc/developer.md) ‚Äî Development environment and workflow details.
- [`doc/c64-rest-api.md`](doc/c64-rest-api.md) ‚Äî Summary of the c64 REST endpoints.
- [`doc/c64-basic-spec.md`](doc/c64-basic-spec.md) ‚Äî BASIC tokenisation and PRG file layout.
- [`doc/c64-openapi.yaml`](doc/c64-openapi.yaml) ‚Äî OpenAPI 3.1 description of the REST surface.

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

  The `c64_host` value can be either a hostname (e.g. `c64u`) or an IP address. Save the file as `~/.c64mcp.json`.

  You can override the path with the `C64MCP_CONFIG` environment variable.

   If the file is missing, the server first looks for the bundled [`.c64mcp.json`](.c64mcp.json) in the project root, and finally falls back to `http://c64u`.



## Build & Test üß™

- `npm run build` ‚Äî type-check the TypeScript sources and generate `mcp-manifest.json` by scanning `@McpTool` annotations.
- `npm test` ‚Äî run the integration tests against an in-process mock that emulates the c64 REST API.
- `npm test -- --real` ‚Äî exercise the same tests against a real c64 device. The runner reuses your MCP config (`~/.c64mcp.json` or `C64MCP_CONFIG`) to determine the base URL, and falls back to `http://c64u`. You can also override explicitly with `--base-url=http://<host>`.
- `npm run check` ‚Äî convenience command that runs both the type-check and the mock-backed test suite.

The test runner accepts the following options:

- `--mock` (default): use the bundled mock hardware emulator.
- `--real`: talk to physical hardware (requires reachable C64 device).
- `--base-url=http://host[:port]`: override the REST base URL when running with `--real`.

## Available Tools üß∞

## Using with GitHub Copilot in VS Code ÔøΩ‚Äçüíª

GitHub Copilot Chat (version 1.214+) includes native MCP support. To enable C64 MCP integration:

### Step 1: Enable MCP in Copilot Chat

- Open VS Code and ensure GitHub Copilot Chat extension is installed and signed in.
- Open **Settings** ‚Üí **Extensions** ‚Üí **GitHub Copilot** ‚Üí **Chat: Experimental: MCP**.
- Enable the **MCP** checkbox.
- Restart VS Code.

### Step 2: Configure the C64 MCP Server

Add this configuration to your workspace `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "github.copilot.chat.experimental.mcp": {
    "servers": [
      {
        "name": "c64-mcp",
        "url": "http://localhost:8000",
  "manifestPath": "/absolute/path/to/c64-mcp/mcp-manifest.json",
        "type": "http"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Important:** Replace `/absolute/path/to/c64-mcp/` with the actual absolute path to your c64-mcp project directory.

### Step 3: Start the MCP Server

```bash
npm start
```

Keep this running‚Äîit will log successful connectivity to your C64 device.

### Step 4: Use MCP Tools in Copilot Chat

More system, drive, file, streaming, and SID tools are available. For the full list and parameters, see the generated `mcp-manifest.json` (built) or the legacy [`src/mcpManifest.json`](src/mcpManifest.json).

## Minimal CLI interaction üíª

If you want to exercise the MCP endpoints from a terminal, you can call them directly with `curl` (or any HTTP client). Examples:

```bash
# Upload and run HELLO WORLD
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"program": "10 PRINT \"HELLO\"\n20 GOTO 10"}' \
  http://localhost:8000/tools/upload_and_run_basic | jq

# Fetch the current screen buffer
curl -s http://localhost:8000/tools/read_screen | jq

# Reset or reboot the machine
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/tools/reset_c64
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/tools/reboot_c64
```

Any endpoint listed in the generated `mcp-manifest.json` (or `src/mcpManifest.json`) can be invoked the same way by posting JSON to `/tools/<name>`.

## Local RAG üï∏Ô∏è

This server includes a local RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) subsystem that indexes sample Commodore 64 source code and hardware information from the `data` folder on startup.

It maintains several compact JSON indices at `data/embeddings_*.json` which are generated using a deterministic, offline embedding model.

Override the output directory by setting `RAG_EMBEDDINGS_DIR` (defaults to `data/`). The index auto-rebuilds when files under `data` change (polling every `RAG_REINDEX_INTERVAL_MS`, default 15000 ms).

- Programmatic use inside MCP flow: the server uses the retriever to inject relevant examples into prompts. You can also call helper endpoints to validate retrieval:
  - `GET /rag/retrieve?q=<text>&k=3&lang=basic|asm` ‚Äî returns reference snippets
  - `POST /tools/rag_retrieve_basic` body `{ "q": "your query", "k": 3 }`
  - `POST /tools/rag_retrieve_asm` body `{ "q": "your query", "k": 3 }`

Examples:

```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:8000/rag/retrieve?q=draw%20a%20sine%20wave&k=3&lang=basic" | jq
curl -s -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"q":"cycle border colors","k":3}' \
  http://localhost:8000/tools/rag_retrieve_asm | jq
```

You can add your data (source code, hardware information, Markdown notes, etc.) anywhere under the `data` folder. The indexer scans subdirectories recursively and picks up changes automatically.

A small curated set of documentation from `doc/` is also indexed; by default this includes [`doc/6502-instructions.md`](doc/6502-instructions.md).

To include additional documentation without moving files, set `RAG_DOC_FILES` to a comma-separated list of paths before running `npm run rag:rebuild` or starting the server with `RAG_BUILD_ON_START=1`.

### RAG Rebuild Policy

- Default behaviour (from this PR onward): no background reindex and no build-on-start to avoid churn and merge conflicts.The test runner forces `RAG_EMBEDDINGS_DIR=artifacts/test-embeddings` so CI and local builds never touch the tracked JSON files unless you opt in.
  - Set `RAG_REINDEX_INTERVAL_MS=0` (default) to disable periodic reindex.
  - Omit `RAG_BUILD_ON_START`; the server will load existing indices if present and otherwise operate with empty indexes.
- Opt-in rebuilds:
  - Trigger a one-time on-start rebuild by exporting `RAG_BUILD_ON_START=1`.
  - Or run `npm run rag:rebuild` explicitly to rebuild indices.
- CI recommended settings: `RAG_REINDEX_INTERVAL_MS=0` and do not set `RAG_BUILD_ON_START`.

To minimize diffs, the indexer writes files only when contents change and keeps a stable, sorted record order.

### External Sources

Extending the RAG from external sources is a three-step process: discover sources, fetch content from them, and add the content to the index.

#### Discover

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is experimental.

To discover new C64 sources on GitHub, first create a `.env` file with GitHub credentials with these contents:

```env
GITHUB_TOKEN=<personalAccessToken>
```

The `<personalAccessToken>` can be issued at [GitHub Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens) with these values:

- Expiration: 90 days
- Resource owner: Your GitHub user account
- Repository access: All repositories
- Access type: Public repositories
- Permissions: Metadata (Read-only), Contents (Read-only)

Then run:

```bash
npm install --save-dev dotenv-cli
npx dotenv -e .env -- npm run rag:discover
```

This will extend the file `src/rag/sources.csv`.

#### Fetch

To download sources available at locations defined in `src/rag/sources.csv`:

1. (Optional) Extend `src/rag/sources.csv` (columns: `type,description,link,depth`) with new sources.
1. Fetch sources (opt-in, no network on builds/tests):

   ```bash
   npm run rag:fetch
   ```

#### Rebuild

1. Rebuild the RAG index to incorporate new or changed sources:

   ```bash
   # either rely on the running server's auto-reindexer (default ~15s), or
   npm run rag:rebuild
   ```

#### Notes

- Downloads are stored under `external/` (gitignored) and included in the index alongside `data/*`.
- If you delete files from `external/` and rebuild, their content will be removed from the RAG. To ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù current embeddings, avoid rebuilding (e.g., set `RAG_REINDEX_INTERVAL_MS=0`) until you want to refresh.

For advanced options (depth semantics, throttling/limits, adaptive rate limiting, retries, logs, and environment overrides), see the dedicated section in `doc/developer.md`.

## Utility Scripts üõ†Ô∏è

- `npm run c64:tool` ‚Äî interactive helper that can:
  - convert a BASIC file to a PRG and store it under `artifacts/` (or a path you choose),
  - convert and immediately run the generated PRG on the configured c64 device,
  - upload an existing PRG and run it on the c64 device.
- `npm run api:generate` ‚Äî regenerate the typed REST client under `generated/c64/` from [`doc/c64-openapi.yaml`](doc/c64-openapi.yaml).
- Advanced users can call the underlying CLI directly:

  ```bash
  node --import ./scripts/register-ts-node.mjs scripts/c64-cli.mjs convert-basic --input path/to/program.bas
  node --import ./scripts/register-ts-node.mjs scripts/c64-cli.mjs run-basic --input path/to/program.bas
  node --import ./scripts/register-ts-node.mjs scripts/c64-cli.mjs run-prg --input artifacts/program.prg
  ```

Generated binaries are written to the `artifacts/` directory by default (ignored by git) so you can transfer them to real hardware or flash media. Make sure your `~/.c64mcp.json` (or `C64MCP_CONFIG`) points at your c64 device before using the run options.

## Troubleshooting üõü

If the MCP server is not reachable or VS Code integration isn't working, see the comprehensive troubleshooting guide:

**üìã [MCP Troubleshooting Guide](doc/troubleshooting-mcp.md)**

Quick diagnosis commands:

```bash
# Check if server is running
lsof -i :8000

# Test basic connectivity  
curl -s http://localhost:8000/tools/info

# Emergency restart
pkill -f "npm start" && PORT=8000 npm start
```
