  - Dependencies: `silence_and_verify`
  - **PRIORITY: #10** — Advanced feature, implement later

### 4. Debug Streaming & Assembly Verification (COMPLEX)

**Problem**: Verifying assembly execution requires debug stream integration

**High-Impact Tools** (all require infrastructure):

## Reprioritized Rollout Order

Based on impact analysis focusing on:
1. **Immediate agent effectiveness** (find and run programs, compose music)
2. **Low-hanging fruit** (small effort, high impact)
3. **Foundation for future work** (enables other tools)
4. **Deferring complex infrastructure** (debug streaming to Post-GA)

### New High-Priority Sequence

#### Quick Wins (Phase 2a — High Impact, Low Effort)
1. **`find_and_run_program_by_name`** (45min) — Enables program discovery
2. **`silence_and_verify`** (35min) — Essential for SID work
3. **`filesystem_stats_by_extension`** (35min) — Context for file operations
4. **`music_compile_play_analyze`** (90min) — Complete music workflow

#### Graphics & Extraction (Phase 2b — Medium Effort, High Value)
5. **`extract_sprites_from_ram`** (80min) — Graphics extraction
6. **`rip_charset_from_ram`** (75min) — Character set extraction
7. **`drive_mount_and_verify`** (45min) — Reliable disk handling

#### Advanced Features (Phase 2c — Lower Priority)
8. **`classify_prg_basic_or_mc`** (45min) — Program classification
9. **`screen_capture_timeline`** (50min) — Timeline recording
10. **`sid_param_sweep`** (90min) — SID experimentation
11. **`create_and_mount_blank_d64`** (35min) — Disk creation
12. **`memory_snapshot_and_diff`** (50min) — Memory comparison
13. **`disassemble_ram_region`** (60min) — Disassembly

#### Container & Classification (Phase 3 — When Filesystem Work Needed)
- **`container_aware_walk_and_classify`** (60min)
- **`dedup_scan`** (60min)
- **`dedup_plan_and_apply`** (75min)

#### Debug Streaming (Phase 5 — Post Infrastructure)
- All debug stream tools deferred until UDP infrastructure is ready
- These are high-value but require significant foundation work

## Key Insights

### Why This Order?

1. **`find_and_run_program_by_name` is #1** because it's the most requested feature — agents need to find programs in disk collections. Without this, users must manually locate files.

2. **`silence_and_verify` is #2** because it's a quick win (35min) that unblocks all SID testing and music composition work. Currently, SID tests can be flaky without proper silence verification.

3. **Graphics tools (#5-6)** are grouped together because they share similar patterns (RAM scanning, pattern detection, export). Implementing them consecutively leverages shared code.

4. **Debug streaming deferred** because it needs infrastructure (UDP pipeline, backpressure, performance testing) that would take weeks to implement properly. Better to ship other high-value features first.

### Impact on Agent Capabilities

After implementing the Phase 2a quick wins, agents will be able to:
- ✅ Find and run any program in a C64 file collection by name
- ✅ Reliably test SID music with proper silence verification
- ✅ Understand file collection contents and statistics
- ✅ Create and verify complete music compositions in one workflow

After Phase 2b graphics tools:
- ✅ Extract sprites and character sets from running programs
- ✅ Build reusable graphics libraries
- ✅ Analyze and learn from existing C64 graphics

### ROI Summary

**Top 4 Quick Wins (Phase 2a)**: ~205 minutes (3.4 hours)
- Unlocks: Program discovery, music composition, file navigation
- Impact: Transforms agent from "follow instructions" to "find and create"

**Graphics Suite (Phase 2b)**: ~200 minutes (3.3 hours)
- Unlocks: Sprite/charset extraction, graphics analysis
- Impact: Enables graphics-focused workflows

**Total High-Priority Work**: ~6.7 hours for 11 tools
- Massive improvement in agent capabilities
- All low-risk (no infrastructure dependencies)
- Clear, testable outcomes

### Deferred Work: Debug Streaming

Debug streaming tools (Phase 5) are incredibly valuable but require:
- UDP packet ingest infrastructure (~40 hours)
- Performance validation (~8 hours)
- Observability & monitoring (~8 hours)
- Integration testing (~16 hours)

**Total infrastructure: ~72 hours** before first debug tool can ship (see `rollout.md` Phase 5 for detailed breakdown)

**Decision**: Ship high-value, low-complexity features first (Phases 2a-3), then revisit debug streaming as a separate project with dedicated infrastructure sprint.

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Implement Phase 2a (quick wins) in next sprint
2. **Near-term**: Follow with Phase 2b (graphics) when graphics work is prioritized
3. **Medium-term**: Phase 2c and Phase 3 tools as needed based on user feedback
4. **Long-term**: Plan debug streaming infrastructure project, then implement Phase 5

This prioritization maximizes near-term agent effectiveness while deferring complex infrastructure work that would block faster progress.
