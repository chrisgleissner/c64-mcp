# VICE Binary Monitor vs Ultimate 64 REST API

This document summarizes the union of capabilities exposed by the [VICE Binary Monitor protocol](https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io/vice_13.html) and the [Ultimate 64 REST API](https://1541u-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/api_calls.html). Each row shows how to invoke the feature through either interface and highlights functional gaps.

## Memory and CPU State

| Capability | VICE Binary Monitor | Ultimate REST API | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Memory read | ðŸŸ¢ `0x01` Memory Get â€” body `[sidefx,start_lo,start_hi,end_lo,end_hi,memspace,bank_lo,bank_hi]`; response `0x01` with length and data block. | ðŸŸ¡ `GET /v1/machine:readmem?address=$ADDR&length=$LEN` (DMA map, default length 256). | Binary monitor supports memspaces and banks; REST access is limited to the flattened DMA-visible map and must not wrap past `$FFFF`. |
| Memory write | ðŸŸ¢ `0x02` Memory Set â€” request extends Memory Get body with the payload bytes for `[start,end]`. | ðŸŸ¡ `PUT /v1/machine:writemem?address=$ADDR&data=...` or `POST /v1/machine:writemem` with binary attachment. | Monitor enforces payload length match and offers side-effect control; REST writes up to 128 bytes per call using the current DMA mapping. |
| Register snapshot | ðŸŸ¢ `0x31` Registers Get â€” body `[memspace]`; response lists `(size,id,value_lo,value_hi)` tuples. | ðŸ”´ Not available (except `GET /v1/machine:debugreg` for `$D7FF`). | REST lacks general-purpose register visibility; only the Ultimate 64 debug register is exposed. |
| Register update | ðŸŸ¢ `0x32` Registers Set â€” `[memspace,count,{size,id,value_lo,value_hi,...}]`; response echoes `0x31`. | ðŸ”´ Not available. | Direct CPU register writes require the monitor. |
| Banks enumeration | ðŸŸ¢ `0x82` Banks Available â€” lists bank IDs and names for `e_comp_space`. | ðŸ”´ Not available. | REST cannot query cartridge banks; the monitor is needed for bank-aware tools. |
| Register catalog | ðŸŸ¢ `0x83` Registers Available â€” reports register IDs, bit widths, and names. | ðŸ”´ Not available. | REST offers no equivalent metadata. |
| VICE info | ðŸŸ¡ `0x85` VICE Info â€” returns `VERSION_RC_NUMBER` and optional revision bytes. | ðŸŸ¢ `GET /v1/version`, `GET /v1/info`. | REST delivers richer device metadata (product, firmware, FPGA); monitor only returns emulator build numbers. |
| Ping | ðŸŸ¢ `0x81` Ping â€” empty request/response. | ðŸŸ¢ `GET /v1/version` (lightweight health check). | Monitor ping also verifies API negotiation (error `0x82` on bad version). |

## Breakpoints, Conditions, and Execution Flow

| Capability | VICE Binary Monitor | Ultimate REST API | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Create checkpoint | ðŸŸ¢ `0x12` Checkpoint Set â€” `[start,end,stop,enabled,op_mask,temporary,(optional)memspace]`; response `0x11`. | ðŸ”´ Not available. | Only the monitor exposes code/data breakpoints. |
| Query checkpoint | ðŸŸ¢ `0x11` Checkpoint Get â€” `[checknum]`; response `0x11`. | ðŸ”´ Not available. | REST has no breakpoint introspection. |
| Delete checkpoint | ðŸŸ¢ `0x13` Checkpoint Delete â€” `[checknum]`. | ðŸ”´ Not available. | â€” |
| Toggle checkpoint | ðŸŸ¢ `0x15` Checkpoint Toggle â€” `[checknum,enable]`. | ðŸ”´ Not available. | â€” |
| List checkpoints | ðŸŸ¢ `0x14` Checkpoint List â€” emits one `0x11` per entry then `0x14` with total count. | ðŸ”´ Not available. | â€” |
| Conditional breakpoint | ðŸŸ¢ `0x22` Condition Set â€” `[checknum,len,expr_bytes]`. | ðŸ”´ Not available. | Expressions mirror CLI monitor syntax. |
| Step/advance | ðŸŸ¢ `0x71` Advance Instructions â€” `[step_over,count_lo,count_hi]`. | ðŸ”´ Not available. | REST cannot single-step; use pause/resume only. |
| Execute until return | ðŸŸ¢ `0x73` Execute Until Return. | ðŸ”´ Not available. | â€” |
| Keyboard feed | ðŸŸ¢ `0x72` Keyboard Feed (API header must be `0x02`). | ðŸ”´ Not available. | Useful for scripted monitor input; REST offers no keyboard injection. |
| Jam/stop/resume events | ðŸŸ¢ Async responses `0x61/0x62/0x63` with request ID `0xffffffff`. | ðŸ”´ Not available. | REST lacks push notifications; clients must poll status. |

## Machine Lifecycle

| Capability | VICE Binary Monitor | Ultimate REST API | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Exit monitor | ðŸŸ¢ `0xAA` Exit â€” releases control back to emulator loop. | ðŸŸ¡ Not required. | REST calls run out-of-band and do not halt the CPU by default. |
| Quit emulator/device | ðŸŸ¡ `0xBB` Quit â€” invokes `mon_quit()`. | ðŸŸ¢ `PUT /v1/machine:poweroff` (powers off), `PUT /v1/machine:reboot`. | Monitor quit terminates VICE; REST poweroff stops the Ultimate hardware. |
| Reset | ðŸŸ¢ `0xCC` Reset â€” `[reset_type]` (0 soft, 1 hard, 8â€“11 drive IDs). | ðŸŸ¢ `PUT /v1/machine:reset` (system), `PUT /v1/drives/{drive}:reset` (per-drive). | Monitor supports fine-grained drive resets via type codes; REST splits drive resets per endpoint. |
| Pause/resume | ðŸŸ¡ Resume controlled by exiting monitor; stop state signaled with `0x62/0x63`. | ðŸŸ¢ `PUT /v1/machine:pause` / `PUT /v1/machine:resume`. | REST offers explicit pause control without entering a monitor. |
| Autostart/run program | ðŸŸ¡ `0xDD` Autostart â€” `[run_flag,file_index,name_len,name_bytes]`. | ðŸŸ¢ `PUT/POST /v1/runners:run_prg` (DMA load + run) or `...:load_prg` (load only). | Monitor autostart exits the monitor after queuing the autostart; REST runners reset the machine automatically. |

## Snapshots, Display, and Peripherals

| Capability | VICE Binary Monitor | Ultimate REST API | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Save snapshot | ðŸŸ¢ `0x41` Dump Snapshot â€” `[save_roms,save_disks,name_len,name_bytes]`. | ðŸ”´ Not available. | REST has no snapshot API. |
| Load snapshot | ðŸŸ¢ `0x42` Undump Snapshot â€” `[name_len,name_bytes]`; response returns PC. | ðŸ”´ Not available. | â€” |
| Display capture | ðŸŸ¢ `0x84` Display Get (API `0x02`) â€” `[alt_canvas,mode]`; response includes geometry metadata and pixel buffer. | ðŸŸ¡ `PUT /v1/streams/video:start?ip=host[:port]` for live UDP streaming (Ultimate 64 only). | Monitor provides immediate framebuffer dumps; REST streams continuous video but no single-frame capture. |
| Palette capture | ðŸŸ¢ `0x91` Palette Get â€” `[alt_canvas]`; returns RGB triples. | ðŸ”´ Not available. | REST lacks palette inspection. |
| Joyport output | ðŸŸ¢ `0xA2` Joyport Set â€” `[port_lo,port_hi,value_lo,value_hi]`. | ðŸ”´ Not available. | REST cannot toggle joystick lines. |
| Userport output | ðŸŸ¢ `0xB2` Userport Set â€” `[value_lo,value_hi]`. | ðŸ”´ Not available. | â€” |
| Keyboard injection | ðŸŸ¢ `0x72` Keyboard Feed. | ðŸ”´ Not available. | â€” |

## Configuration and Resources

| Capability | VICE Binary Monitor | Ultimate REST API | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Resource read | ðŸŸ¡ `0x51` Resource Get â€” `[name_len,name_bytes]`; response indicates type and value. | ðŸŸ¡ `GET /v1/configs`, `GET /v1/configs/{category}`, `GET /v1/configs/{category}/{item}`. | Monitor accesses emulator resource system; REST targets Ultimate firmware settings. |
| Resource write | ðŸŸ¡ `0x52` Resource Set â€” `[type,name_len,name_bytes,value_len,value_bytes]`. | ðŸŸ¡ `PUT /v1/configs/{...}?value=...`, `POST /v1/configs` (batch). | Resource namespaces differ: monitor affects VICE runtime options, REST changes Ultimate firmware configuration. |
| Batch configuration | ðŸ”´ Not available. | ðŸŸ¢ `POST /v1/configs` (nested JSON). | â€” |
| Load/save config to flash | ðŸ”´ Not available. | ðŸŸ¢ `PUT /v1/configs:load_from_flash`, `PUT /v1/configs:save_to_flash`. | Flash persistence is firmware-specific. |
| Factory reset config | ðŸ”´ Not available. | ðŸŸ¢ `PUT /v1/configs:reset_to_default`. | â€” |

## Media, Drives, and Audio (REST Exclusive)

| Capability | VICE Binary Monitor | Ultimate REST API | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SID playback | ðŸ”´ Not available. | ðŸŸ¢ `PUT/POST /v1/runners:sidplay`. | Hardware audio runners are outside the scope of the monitor. |
| MOD playback | ðŸ”´ Not available. | ðŸŸ¢ `PUT/POST /v1/runners:modplay`. | â€” |
| Cartridge/PRG DMA load | ðŸŸ¡ Autostart (`0xDD`) accepts filenames from the host FS. | ðŸŸ¢ `PUT/POST /v1/runners:run_crt`, `...:run_prg`, `...:load_prg`. | Monitor runs within VICE and uses its virtual FS; REST accesses the Ultimate storage or uploaded payloads. |
| Drive management | ðŸ”´ Not available (except checkpointing on drive CPU via memspace). | ðŸŸ¢ `/v1/drives` (info), `/v1/drives/{drive}:mount`, `:remove`, `:on`, `:off`, `:set_mode`, `:load_rom`. | REST controls physical drive emulation directly. |
| File image creation | ðŸ”´ Not available. | ðŸŸ¢ `PUT /v1/files/{path}:create_d64/d71/d81/dnp`. | Monitor has no disk image authoring commands. |
| Data streams | ðŸ”´ Not available. | ðŸŸ¢ `PUT /v1/streams/<stream>:start` / `PUT /v1/streams/<stream>:stop` (stream = `video`, `audio`, `debug`). | REST can export live video/audio/debug streams. |

## Observations

- The VICE Binary Monitor is the only interface that exposes low-level debugger primitives (breakpoints, register manipulation, single-stepping, framebuffer snapshots, palette dumps, joystick/userport control).
- The Ultimate REST API focuses on machine orchestration and firmware-level services (DMA loading, media playback, drive management, persistent configuration, and streaming), none of which are available through the binary monitor.
- Memory access and reset operations overlap; however, the monitor supports banked address spaces and fine-grained CPU control, while the REST DMA endpoints operate on the flattened Ultimate memory view and offer coarse pause/resume semantics.
- Integrations needing both precise debugging and system management typically combine the monitor for CPU/memory inspection with REST calls for device control and file management.
