# Knowledge Improvement Rollout Working Notes

## Required Reading Confirmation

- `doc/improve-knowledge/plan.md` — Reviewed priorities and scoped improvements.
- `doc/developer.md` — Reviewed contribution workflow, testing gates (`npm run check`), and documentation update expectations.
- `README.md` (API and MCP surface sections) — Reconfirmed autogenerated tool/resource tables and need to update documentation alongside code changes.

## Key Acceptance Criteria from the Improvement Plan

- **Structured RAG outputs (R1)**: Responses must include structured fields (`uri`, `origin`, `snippet`, `score`) so `ReadResource` consumers can follow references without parsing prose.
- **Memory/IO resource exposure (K1)**: Memory maps and IO reference docs under `data/memory` and `data/io` must be published as MCP resources with appropriate metadata for retrieval and grounding.
- **SID best-practices resource (K2)**: `data/audio/sid-programming-best-practices.md` must be surfaced as a first-class MCP resource to guide audio tools and prompts.
- **Validation gates**: Each improvement requires incremental changes with companion tests or documentation updates, followed by a successful `npm run check` prior to marking tasks complete.
