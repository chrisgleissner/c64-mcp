# Documentation Folder

This directory contains **developer and extended user documentation** for this Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.  

Unlike the [`data`](../data/README.md) folder, which provides domain-specific C64 knowledge, this directory focuses on **implementation details** and  **usage guides** relevant to developers of this project, and end users.

All documents in this folder are included in the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** index to allow the MCPâ€™s AI components to retrieve and reason about internal design and operational aspects.
