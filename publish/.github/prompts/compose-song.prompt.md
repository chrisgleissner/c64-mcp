Goal: Create a simple, pleasant SID melody with expressive phrasing.
Guidelines:
- Use triangle or pulse wave with ADSR settings such as A=1–2, D=2–4, S=6–10, R=3–6.
- Vary note lengths and add phrase breathing so the song feels alive.
- C major motifs work well for quick demos.

Output:
- Provide either a BASIC music program or a SIDWAVE specification.
- Include tempo and approximate bar phrasing in the response.
